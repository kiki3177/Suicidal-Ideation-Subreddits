u/_Concert_,"Numb I’m graduating this year. As the date gets closer and closer I feel worse. What if I can’t what if I can’t get into college. I’ve always been a loner. I’m really shy and talking to new people is damn near closer to impossible. For the first time since I moved in 4th grade I felt good about like. I was happy to get up in the morning which is something I haven’t felt in more the ten years. Then I started like this kid I knew from the start it was a bad idea within weeks I was back to hating myself. And when he did break my heart I wanted to die so bad. But I tried to hold on into the happy self but once December hit it was gone. December 29th is my anniversary of trying to kill myself and since it happened in 2020 the wounds are still fresh. School was dragging on. Finally it was break but no matter what I tried I wasn’t excited for Christmas. Now it’s New Years and my neglectful and alcoholic parents are singing down stair with there alcoholic friends and my head is pounding. All I want is to die. I want all this pain physical and mental to stop.

u/tropicalrainforest,"I think 2022 might be it. So, a little background on me real quick. Not that I actually give two shits if you need context or not. I’m a licensed social worker. The dude that helps people with their problems. Or at least, I used to be. I have given up on that career. Anyway. What you should know about me is that I’ve been on anti depressants and mood stabilizers for over a decade. I’ve had several therapists. I’ve had a few of your stereotypical bad relationships along the way. I really don’t feel special any more. Trust me, I completely comprehend and understand that my body is incapable of producing the right chemicals to make me a baseline functional human being. I know that. But, every time I see even the smallest glimmer of something good for me it gets destroyed. Sounds trivial perhaps, but someone I recently met, who I really thought liked me…not romantically I should mention…just blocked me on social media out of the clear blue sky. It’s seriously fucking with my head. I honestly just want to go. I don’t care when or how. I just don’t want to be alive any more. I have really tried hard. I wanted to be dead at 19, and I’m 30. I’m a tough son of a bitch but I’ve run my race, it’s time. I’m ready. The joy is gone. My meaning is nonexistent. I have burned so many bridges and I have messed up so many wonderful chances. I don’t want any of what I have right now. Every day I contemplate my death. I’m tired and I really just want to be laid to rest.

I feel like I've built up some expectation that I'm gonna fucking be Jeff Bezos when I'm older and not really being allowed to have friends since I'm autistic and stupid. I really want to live my life, but again what's the point of it when you can live in eternal peace, where we are all equal?

A couple months ago it appears I attempted to commit suicide; I had a plan and followed through with it until my first couple of deep cuts- they scared me (they were the deepest I had done) and I quickly put a baby wipe over them and tied a hair tie around my arm keeping the wipe in place (tight), put a jumper on and went about my day as usual. The thing is, I have trouble saying that I “attempted to kms” because in my head it wasn’t like any of the other attempts where people wake up in hospital or anything. I have dark purple/red scars left months later from the deep cuts from my “attemp” but am I right to think that it wasn’t a serious attempt or is it just denial?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rtf8tz/suicide_attempt_not_serious/,rtf8tz,1.

u/Slideitinhoney,"I’ve took about 8 Xanax. 15 Oxy 10’s with no tolerance to either along with 40 200mg somas and I’m drinking a 6 pack of 5% beers and 3/5 or a little more than 1/4 of 40% alcohol my goal is permanent sleep. I know it sounds dumb but this is all happening because of a girl. I hadn’t had goodluck with girls, all of them have been manipulative and convinced me I was at fault for them cheated and they somehow got me to believe it snd I forgave them for a while until they left me for the person they cheated on me with. That’s when my heart shattered. The next serious relationship the girl had mental problems and would Rey going into the street to be ran over and I would have to have passerby’s call the ambulance while I held her back from the street and she would smack me across the face and beat me wherever she could land her punches and I don’t know if you’ve ever dealt with anyone with mental problems but they seem to gain extreme strength and those punches hurt and she even broken my glasses when she punches me in my face and made my nose bleed. 


She was ordered to a state rehabilitation program for mentally ill where she wasn’t allowed to leave but was allowed visitors for 2 hours everyday and it just so happened to be when it was dark she snuck to me an area where there were no cameras and a wall protecting us from anyone walking by and she asked me to umm well do her right then and there and she pulled down her underwear and pants and bent over and without her knowing I put on a condom (it was in a city and there was a lot of noise including muscle cars racing by snd cars honking there horns etc so you couldn’t hear much) so I did her and she thought I was raw so she asked me to finish in her raw that she wanted to feel well umm my little tadpoles in white liquid to keep it pg go inside and fill up her hole and when I said no she got mad and said why do I even come visit her. 

The next one moved way too fast we had barely been talking for 2 days and she already wanted me to ask her out and when I had to go to the hospital unexpectedly my phone wasn’t charged and it died from texting her and she got mad and accused me of cheating and when I went to spend the night I was still abusing opiates and I poured a 3 of codeine and two Xanax bars so I was passing out and don’t remember much just glimpses and I recall a little memory where she’s unbuttoning my pants as I was just unconscious and next thing i remember she’s giving me fellatio and next I remember her grabbing my hand using it to finger herself, the last thing I remember last was her getting on top of me trying to ride me but since I was off codeine and Xanax my male part wasn’t working right snd I remember her getting frustrated and grabbing my head and forcing her to give her oral stimulation before I passed out or blacked out and early in the morning she woke me up and said she was dropping me off and the day before in the way to her apartment she was so chatty and was talking so much but this time as she was dropping me off a good 40 minutes away she didn’t say a word and it was one of the most trumatic experiences I had ever experienced and it took a while for me to get the confidence to do things with a girl again. 

This last one started off fine, great actually everything was going good we both agreed we wanted something long term and serious and if it got to that point we wanted to get married and have kids. Everything was going fine keep in mind we had a conversation when we first started talking and she said she didn’t want someone who was going to ghost her or ignore her because she had experienced that snd it felt horrible and I agreed I wouldn’t do that and I treated her amazing like a queen but out of no where she ghosted me before blocking me on everything without so much as a goodbye and that really hurt snd has me in serious pain which is why I took all those substances, I want to escape the pain and the cruel world.

If anyone is awake and is down to talk to a sad man with nothing to lose snd possible death coming soon I wouldn’t mind talking to you guys during my possible final moments in fact I hope I get some messages so I don’t die alone. Thank you to anyone who reads this, bless you and your soul.



[UPDATE] for anyone that cares or was still wondering I did make it through the night. I started throwing up like crazy and was slurring and a friend saw through my cryptic final message I posted on my story and drove to my house and told my parents he thought something was wrong they let him. When he tried knocking and I wouldn’t answer or reply and all they could hear was throwing up my parents unlocked the door and they found me nodding off breathing slow.

They said I couldn’t have been taking more than 15 breaths a minute, and that my eyes were closed and I was just slurring my speech when I tried answering and couldn’t walk on my own they found the bottles of the prescriptions I bought and knew immediately what I took so drove to the hospital with the bottles and doctors from what I remember gave me charcoal for my stomach and I believe said they were going to monitor me that whole day if it didn’t get better with the charcoal within a certain amount of times they were going to pump my stomach and I just got out today from being put into the mental hospital and that’s only because my family called and said they would watch over me and not let be alone for too long or have locked doors for a while and constantly check on me and I promised to try therapy again so I’m waiting on my first appointment even though I still want to die.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rtg7x3/ive_took_about_8_xanax_15_oxy_10s_with_no/,rtg7x3,1.

I've been patient and honest about medication and gone through changes or stayed on longer then I wanted to to make sure I was thorough.

u/xangerella,"'night, Mother I just read the play 'night, Mother by Marsha Norman. 

The play is about a woman, Jessie, who lives with her older mother who plans to kill herself.  She tells her mother she is going to do it, and they spend two hours together talking about everything. 

Jessie tries to get her ready to let her go.

It was exactly everything I've ever felt.

I have never really wanted to be alive, I've had that cliché ""something is wrong with me"" feeling my entire life.  In the play, Jessie is epileptic, and her mother calls these seizures ""fits"".  

I'm not epileptic, but I am autistic, I have other mental illnesses which have always separated me from the world. 

Reading exactly how I feel (although, not taking into consideration, modern things - the play is 40 years old) made me feel even more sure and also even more afraid.

Knowing that even if I choose to keep staying alive, despite what I really want (to die), it will always feel this bad.

My circumstances are really similar to the main character in the play.  I relate to her more than people who are my age right now. 

My mother, who I live with, knows that I am suicidal. She doesn't understand. The mother in the play says things that my own mother would.

u/[deleted],"It's 5:00 AM I don't really know anywhere else to talk about it. I don't really have any friends anymore. No one really reaches out to me, only brief meaningless small talk. 

Making friends after moving to a new city has been a nightmare. A few romantic things, here and there, but it feels like they go as quick as they got there, and never feels like I ever get a reason, or closure.

The fireworks tonight only brought on anxiety and irritation, rather than making me feel happy, like they usually do. I can't even hear knocks on my door without being frozen in fear. Familial and relationship abuse has just stacked up over the years, and it feels like every little thing sets me off somehow.

I'm only 20, no family left and no friends in a big city for the first time. Living in a tiny RV, barely enough money to keep myself alive. High school drop out, college drop out, can't keep a job, bound to end up homeless in the next few months. Can't ever sleep, can't ever manage to drag myself out of bed anymore when I do manage to get some rest. And my luck never turns. It's always something going wrong, and I never get a chance to just breathe, and feel like everything is OK.

I wish I would have had the guts to kill myself as a teen, rather than waiting to see what was in store for me as an adult.

I no longer have the energy or motivation to try and put myself in a better position.

u/Financial_Advisor500,"Terminal State I am stuck. 7 years ago, I fell apart. I started drinking and fell into addiction. It escalated over the course of a year and a half into hard drugs. I was arrested. Compound that with a sexual identity crisis and I cheated on my wife of 4 years and the mother of my two daughters by getting a bj from a stranger off of Grindr. Out of guilt, I told her. Two years after that, she divorced me. 14 years together with 6.5 of those married all destroyed despite our best efforts (counseling, rehab, meds, etc).

Well, it turns out that I have borderline personality disorder and that fairly well accounts for—but does not excuse—my behavior. After the aforementioned counseling, rehab, and meds (and plenty of them all), I am significantly more stable. Admittedly not as much so as before I fell apart 7 years ago, but I’m remaining sober and have a much better sense of how to handle my own disordered mind and associated behavior.

That’s nice and all, but it’s an empty achievement since I have nothing left. I left my career in financial services to be a stay-at-home dad when our first girl was born. I switched to education and that fell apart as my addiction and the arrest derailed things. It was hard to find and keep a job especially with the pandemic complicating matters. I’m employed now in a dead-end job making $12.50 an hour. It’s not enough for rent and child support and living, but it’s what I’ve got. I don’t have a love life. Can’t have one. Religiously, since I was divorced because of the drugs and infidelity (albeit 2 years after the fact), I cannot remarry. She can and she’s dating. My daughters informed me of this yesterday. I still love her and miss her and was hoping one day I could show her I’m trustworthy and stable again. Doesn’t seem like that’s an option and it probably shouldn’t be anyway, but I’m selfish. That’s always been the heart of the issue hasn’t it?

So my life is in its terminal state. I will be alone forever. I’ll keep being the every other weekend visitation daddy/babysitter until they grow old enough to either lose interest, move away, or resent me for what they’ll learn I’ve done. I doubt my job situation will ever lead into a career of any significance or even pull me out of poverty, but I honestly don’t really care if it does. At the end of the day, I’ll still come home to an empty home where regret is my only companion.

Nothing is going to change. That’s not an empty prediction, that’s a fact. I’m alone because I have to be and that will not change. I’m stuck managing addiction and borderline personality disorder just so I can stay out of jail and hold down a job. Those illnesses are lifelong; they will not change. I hate this status quo and think back to my old life and cry often. I cry because I hurt my family so much. My history will not change.

I’m a POS who wrecked everything and whines about the situation he landed himself in. There are only two ways out that I see: natural death or suicide, and I really have little to live for given the situation and its finality. I see how my life is going to go since things aren’t going to change, and I hate it all. Why should I force myself to continue living for a life I know is only primed for more loneliness and pain?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rthjn1/terminal_state/,rthjn1,1.

u/idontevencarehdidhd,"No one is nice Humans are not designed to love and support other humans and this is just an objective fact, the only reason the opposite narrative has been pushed so hard is because we are too sensitive to handle the reality. I was raised to believe that my mom and dad and friends and S/O would be my world, but now I only know them as creatures looking for serotonin. And if I can give them that then sure, they’ll be around me. But if I don’t benefit their brain chemicals I’m worthless. I can’t blame them, I’m a human too, just the same. But damn does it hurt. I wanted to live in that fairytale world where humans loved other humans. But it’s all made up. It’s just chemicals that tell us to breed or not get abandoned by the pack that provides you food. 
We’re not worth any less or any more than the next guy, whether we’re mass murderers or charitable sweethearts. At the end of the day, every last one of us is just a pleasure-dump, scrambling for anything that makes us feel good. And if you have to step over other people to achieve that, so be it.

Im trying my best to type properly.
When i had enough alcohol in my system, i grabbed multiple knives and tried to cut my neck. I was hoping id cut an artery but the knife was too dull and tbh, its quite upsetting. I only have shallow cuts even tho i put force into it. I felt like i didnt have a care for the world and trued to cut my neck withoit hilding back but it didnt work so noe i just hav3 multiple  cuts on my neck. Ill probably himiliatr my siater without even trying becaus3 of it. We rented a place with her friends and if they see the cut in my neck and arm, theyll be humiliated. I was ready to die. I jua g 3anted to bleed to death without havinh to stab myself. If i had the knife i left in ouractual house, id probably be gone right now. I genuinelt did not think the knife in this house we rented would be that dull. It seemed sharp and it looked lik3 the teeth of a shark.

I’ve been in bed all day today crying. I need to get my antidepressants because I ran out over a week ago but not managed to get the energy to go out and get them. I’ve lost loads of my hair this year due to stress and I’m permanently in pain and I’m permanently exhausted. I keep having horrendous dizzy spells and I don't know why. 

I have in the past few months actively seeked out sex with guys under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. I'm craving to be loved but I just don't know how to love myself anymore. I have put alot of thought and effort into trying to be healthy and happy but it's difficult to stay on track when really dark things keep happening to me. Everytime I have opened up throughout my life I have been abused or used. I rarely do this now to let people in. I also give everything I can to others and they just take without giving back. I make the most effort to make everyone around me in my family and friends feel loved and cared for but then they will happily throw me aside the instant they get their gratification. I also hate talking about things like this as it sounds like I'm whining and being self absorbed but I swear I'm absolutely not. If anything I let so much slide but it is building up inside of me. My 30th birthday is in 2 weeks - my friends swore they would arrange something big - they have notified me they haven't even bothered and have no intention of doing. My own father didn't call me on Christmas Day - I think he's also really depressed. I have tried to open up to my parents as they have opened up to me about theirs depression and I've done all I can to cheer them up. The most I have got from them is awkward shrugs of them not knowing what I should do. 

I've been alone 250 miles away from home - people keep wanting me to go back but it's expensive and when I'm there they just want me to be happy constantly and sleep on their couches and then leave shortly after. They want me to plan everything for them. 

I'm exhausted - I'm broken - I'm lonely and I feel used. I'm a strong person to everyone on the outside - I never want to blame anyone else as I'm responsible for my own happiness and this is my journey however I'm deeply hurting. Very very deeply. I am very close to slitting my wrists in the bath so I can get out of it. I just want the end now. I can't keep getting up everyday.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rtljxy/im_running_on_empty/,,1. Seeking help and support

I wasn't expecting to make it to my birthday (Dec 4th). I didn't want to make it to my birthday, but now it's after new years and I still deal with suicidal ideation. I might tell someone, because in all honesty I don't really want to die. I don't trust myself, I really don't , and I've considered asking my parents for me to be sent to a psych ward but we were gonna go on vacation and I didn't want to ruin it. Were still on vacation, and I'm considering asking to go when we come back. I'm not sure though, I've already had a bad experience when I was a lot younger relating to cops and psych wards.

u/AliveGur6908,"Yes I have been battling with depresion majorly ever since July 2020. Found a great doctor to help with medication and a great therapist to help with strategies. It was rough the initial months but for a few months all my issues were non existant. No anxiety, no ocd, or depression. I want to say the past week I have felt the same way but worse than ever. I am currently on 3-4 medications. 1 for anxiety, another for anxiety, 1 for sleep, and 1 for depression/ocd. THe issue is every night IO ask for forgiveness of all m,y sins and that I hope I don't wake up the next day that I die. HAs not happened yet, and every day is worse than the previous. Like today I have never felt more depressed. I stare at the xanax and clonazepam and tell myself, maybe if I take an extra pill I will sleep forever. Sometimes I feel like taking the entire bottle and overdosing. I hate it, I feel alone even while living with my parents while hoping to college. I have little friends. My best friend for decades never responds to me and at this point I only have one true friends that goes away to university.

In 2-ish weeks she's moving to a different state for work, meaning she's not coming back. I'll probably see her twice a year if I'm lucky.

u/[deleted],"I feel… lost. Heck, I don’t even know where to begin. I have never expected my life to be like this, but yet here I am.

I am currently 15 years old, and people would call me ‘privileged’ and ‘lucky’, and that my parents love me very much, so I have nothing to be sad about. I started having emotional problems when I was 12, my aunt said that I was seeking attention, then my psychiatrist diagnosed me with emotional disorder. It was so bad that I had stopped going to school, I couldn’t even leave my room and I laid in my bed every day, thinking of k*lling myself and how worthless I am.

It got better for a while when I had medication, but now skipping to 3 years later, it has gotten worse again. I used have it all; I had good grades, I was good at playing the piano, everyone had high expectations for me. Now, I’m a fat loser who has so much issues going on that my piano teacher has given up on me, I literally have no motivation to do anything except gaming, playing games makes the pain go away for a little bit but soon I’ll start thinking about how much of a loser I am, not doing anything but playing games. I tried so many things to make myself happy, but it never works, I still feel empty or sad. It makes me feel like I’ll never be happy.

I hate myself. I hate my body, my weight, I also hate how I can’t open up to anyone, I hate how much stress I give to my parents for dealing with me because I’m worthless and constantly pushing people away. I hate how I always cry, I hate my face, I just want to disappear, maybe it will be better to the people around me. Every night when I go to sleep, these thoughts consume me until I fall asleep.

I live with my parents and my grandmother who has Alzheimer’s. My grandmother constantly forgets everything, and her constant asking me things again and repeating of the same things over and over again stress me out and makes me angry. I told my parents about it, I have my own problems and this just adds much more stress to my life. My parents never stood by my side, they told me to deal with it, have more sympathy and learn to communicate with different kinds of people. I try, I try very hard to understand but sometimes I can’t deal with it. It breaks me because I feel torn between prioritizing my mental health and holding it in because maybe, just maybe, my grandmother deserves more attention and care from my parents than me. I feel so lonely, but I know that this is life and I have to accept it. 
My parents and I have a great relationship, but due to my emotional problems they had to change schools for me, that just added to their financial expenses and I can’t help but feel like a burden. I am always buying things, they don’t reject me because they love me, but I don’t work a part time job, that just makes me feel worse.
My dad is the literal definition of ‘ignorance is bliss’ he never cares about anything unless it involves him directly. My mother on the other hand, cares too much. She is anxious about a lot of things, including my weight. She constantly says that I’m ugly because I’m fat, always compares my body to other people, and I hate it. My mother is a kind of person who loses control of her emotions easily when she’s stressed or angry. She is a really pessimistic person. We have had arguments many times that was just toxic. I love my family, but I do not trust them.

I have friends, but I do not trust them too. I just cant open up to them, I don’t expect them to be able to understand me nor give me useful advice. All of those stereotypical comforts, I have heard them all. And no, it doesn’t get better. I feel lonely all the damn time, I want to talk to someone but I can’t. It feels like I’m suffocating in quicksand; my chest feels like it is being squeezed by a corset. I don’t know what to do, if this continues on, I don’t think I can stand it anymore.

u/Negative-Fan-1382,"Being short makes me suicidal. I am a 17 year old male and I am 5’6”. I am also 125 lbs, so I am a frail looking dude. I have constantly battled body dysmorphia and the feeling of never being good enough. My main problem I guess is the whole getting a girlfriend thing. It’s not like I’m scared of girls; I talk to them like normal people and have normal conversations, but a lot of the time I like the girl. The thing is is that I’m short, and short guys don’t get any time of day when it comes to girls wanting them. There are plenty of guys that are better than me; in fact, they are all better than me. I am the bottom of the barrel when it comes to who a girl would want to date. I feel that I am running out of time and that I need to get a girlfriend now, but its really hard when I am short, skinny, and lacking confidence. I feel like I have a good personality, but I’m constantly hyper-analyzing every conversation I have with girls. Was I annoying? Do they see me as a friend? 

The other thing is that people say all the time to “focus on yourself bro” or “don’t rely on a girl for your happiness.” Like, I am so depressed and tired of the constant race of “success.” I make really good grades and I’m about to go to college in the fall, but I don’t really care. All I can think about is meeting someone who I enjoy being with and having them have mutual feelings. 

Life to me isn’t about the monetary success. It’s more about the relationships you make and the impact you can have on that persons life. I feel like I am always the one providing the emotional support to people and wouldn’t mind having a girlfriend/future wife to be there for me. I have the constant dread that I am going to be lonely for the rest of my life because of my physical appearance. I know that I shouldn’t worry about things that are out of my control, but its really hard being a short guy trying to find someone to love. I know I’m really young but I just feel hopeless and alone. I constantly have thoughts of suicide, and I don’t know what to do.

I want to die. For quite some years now. There were always something to cling to, but I think today is gonna be the last day.

Recently my psychiatrist told me I have depressive personality disorder and from what I understood and researched, it's like I have a birth defect. Won't get better and will always be like this. This crushed me. Why do I have to live just to be like this? I don't want this anymore.

I have this friend, which is more like a sister to me. I was with her this new years' eve. She is the only thing that was keeping me here. I don't wanna make her sad, but don't wanna live either.

They’ve had these thoughts for a while, but always hung in there. They don’t want to go to therapy because they don’t think it will help, and very stubborn to even be open to the idea. And won’t talk about why they feel the way they do with me. So they keep it all to themselves.

I myself feel down, and it’s hard for me to try and be happy and motivate them when they’re just faking it but deep down want to end their life. I don’t want to cut them off for my own sake, I want to make sure they don’t go through with it.

u/Federal-Meeting9960,"getting better 

over the past...three or four days ive become more active on reddit due to the sadness i feel when i read some of these posts.

everyone here feels so hopeless and lost and dead and i know exactly what that feels like. i know what it feels like to feel so empty that it hurts. i know how it is to go through a day and remember none of it except for all the ways to end my life. i know how it feels to be empty all the time and not want to try to get better because it feels like too much energy.

last year i went through one of the worst depressions of my life. i couldnt see myself living to my birthday, and when i did i was shocked. everyday was harder and i convinced myself that i had no will to live, that i had lost everything and nothing even mattered anymore so why not just do it.

the day of my birthday, i planned to die. but i was away from home so i couldnt. i decided id wait another week. everyday of that week was like my soul being sucked out of me, leaving me even more hopeless and depressed than the day before. i genuinely felt like i couldnt make it. there was no way.

how could god put me through this pain and expect me to live? what kind of creator would allow his creation to endure such a torturous life? i felt abandoned and alone.

i feel like as humans when things get too hard...we either fight or give up. or in some cases...both. it all comes down to being tired. running in circles will eventually make you tired, and as humans...when we're tired...we give up. we stop trying. and its so sad.

getting better can feel too overwhelming when the sadness that youve felt for so long is comforting. it fucking sucks but its the truth.

(my advice to anyone who wants to stop feeling this way (and it takes time so be patient) is to start small. start setting small goals like brushing your teeth and eating breakfast, taking a shower or going on a short walk or things like that. any little changes like that will help in the long run. (i know energy is nonexistent when depression is a thing, so always start small. theres no reason to rush or overwhelm yourself even more. &lt;3))

i know what its like to be all sad and shit. but i also know happiness. pure, unfiltered happiness. not mania, or a temporary high, but happiness. the kind of happiness where you wake up feeling lighter, finding it easier to breathe. the kind of happiness where you cant wait to get outside and see the sun and smell the freshness of the air. the kind of happiness where you laugh and dont feel empty afterwards.

everyone deserves to feel that happiness. and i know that it can happen for EVERYONE even the saddest people, no matter where youve been or what youve been through. its such a freeing feeling and thats why ill try to always ask whoever needs it to stay a bit longer because you never ever ever know when that happiness will come but as someone who has had it, i can say that its truly worth living for. if i had killed myself that day, i wouldnt have gotten to feel this happiness. so keep pushing for it.

(everyone is going to die anyway, theres no need to speed up the process.)

(sorry...this is all over the place but i mean it completely. if youve read this far, thank you. you are strong. you are worthy of getting better, no matter what youve done in the past. this is your sign to please hang in there and stay just a bit stronger for a little longer. tomorrow could be your day &lt;3)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rtpssr/getting_better/,rtpssr,1.

I always seem to say things that cause reactions like this. At my one and only job I'd had, some girl I worked with sat down across from me in a booth while I worked, and I literally dumped a bunch of personal shit on her. She was visibly confused and quickly left.

I swear, it's times like these I should seriously just disappear forever. Vanish, kill myself, something, I don't know. 

People can say that I'm being dramatic, but when your life since the moment you could talk to now has been filled with nothing but humiliating moments, why continue? Even writing isn't helping me feel better, and it usually does.

u/urlocalotaku,"Having those thoughts again After about a year of being bullied, beaten, name calling and manipulation, all of that, in school and out, it affected me so much to the point of suicidal tendencies and minor injuries due to self harm. During November and December I've been feeling like shit. For context, I am highly sensitive, with potential anxiety and trying to get a dyspraxia and autism diagnosis. Due to the potential anxiety, I've been having non stop nausea and loss of appetite. I've been more irritable than ever and never happy with anything. 

My parents, however aren't the most supportive. They assume things about me and blame me with no evidence for what I've done. I think my dad has anger issues because he shouts and degrades me every chance he gets. They both call me things like retard, spastic or cuss words. I am extremely clumsy due to potential dyspraxia and I'm constantly humiliated and put down for it.

I've been thinking various things like ""if my mum aborted me I wouldn't care too much"" or ""why am I living this shitty life?""
I don't know if this is considered as abuse, be it emotional or verbal. And yes, my parents used to hit me, I'm sure everyone's did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rtpvy8/having_those_thoughts_again/,rtpvy8,1. Seeking help and support
u/Least-Fig-3412,"Just venting For some reason today it's harder than usual, I don't know what to do to escape my thoughts. I can't wait, but I also can't let myself do it right now anyway. 

I have responsibilities and some work to do, and it's getting harder(i already can't do anything and not sure how I'm going to survive), I don't know how to handle my mental shit anymore. 
There's no opportunity to get ""professional help"" for me, not now, not later, so I have to help myself to be able to function until it's ""convenient"" circumstances to do what I plan. But I can't distract myself, I can't escape, there's nothing I can enjoy even a little, no one I'm really comfortable to talk to, I don't even have myself, I'm the source of my problems so it doesn't seem right and fair to get help, even if it was possible. I can't even allow myself to be comforted, I think, I feel too disgusting. But of course a part of me needs it. 

I feel like I'm losing my mind and I don't know what to expect? Even my (unhealthy) coping mechanisms don't work now. 
I don't understand why it's SO hard, it feels like I have to put a lot of effort just go through another second. It's not an appropriate reaction to the situation and it definitely shouldn't be like this, and I understand it.

Someone better off dead. I go to sleep everyday wishing the next day will be better, that I will change, that something will change, but its always the same. The same pain, the same agony, the same mistakes, the same wishing tomorrow will be better, the same wishing things could change, the same thinking she could ever like me the way I like her. 

Im pathetic, worthless, and naive. I believed that if I kept staying nice to everyone, people would like me, that she would like me. 

An idiot, thats what I am. An idiot that no matter how much wants things to change, keeps making them worse.

The more time passed, the more I felt empty, lonely, worthless, dead. 

I distanced myself from everyone else, trying to bury my feelings. 

I was tired... Tired of people taking me for granted, tired of people thinking Im weak, tired of being a victime, tired of feeling sad, tired of this life. 

I dont know why Im even alive right now, I feel like I have nothing to live for. As if no one would care if I suddenly disappeared. 

Sometimes I still wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.

A few weeks ago, I started to do something I never thought I would ever do. 

I took a knife and started to cut marks on my hand. The worst part is that I expected it to hurt me. But... The pain felt good. It made me forget how I felt for a small amount of time. 

Ever since then, Ive cutted marks on my hand around a dozen of times. Only a few select ones stay more than a few days before disappearing. Its crazy isnt it ? 

I know I shoudnt do that... I know its bad for me but I still do. Its one of the only things that help me realize Im still alive. 

I know Ive changed
I know people have noticed 

Im sorry to all the people who have been hurt because of me.
Im sorry to all the people who waste their time worrying about me, as if I was worth worrying about.

Im all alone.

I desperately want to talk about it with someone, but Im too scared to be judged or to be told that its not important. I dont want to become more of a burden than I already am. 

I just want all of this to end already.

Once i found out I have bipolar disorder I felt relieved that I finally knew the answer. I didn't even understand what my diagnosis meant.  I did the meds and the therapy and it blew up in my face . After quarantine I was terrified to get back on medication because quitting cold turkey was incredibly difficult.  I couldn't be alone I was afraid I was hurt myself and finally succeed in my death.  After cycling again this summer I decided to take my disorder seriously educate myself on what I can do to better my life . Diet sleep routine off weekends at work . Everything was perfect.  I was still struggling with thoughts of suicide to the point I had to leave work early.  I knew eventually I would get fired like I always do. So I tried the meds again. Well they canceled my follow up and I'm running out of meds . I'm freakn out I call the crisis center to possibly arrange a voluntary hold at a mental facility and she said that it doesn't exist here in Tennessee for mental health only for alcohol and substance abuse . I have to actively try to commit suicide for them to help me so after being on the phone for about almost an hour they redirect me to the shitty mental health clinic in my own town !

Heard this so much. Life is temporary and problems are always permanent in this life.What does the difference of a couple more decades of living make if it's just a depressing repitition of waking up exhausted and struggling to go to sleep when we're all going to get too old to help ourselves and die anyways? I've had a decent run and it's been fun, but it's all downhill from here. I've broken too many things beyond fixing and it'll never be the same again.

This world is capable of great beauty and joy, but it's also capable of such anger, pain, and loneliness. What's the point of being here if we have to witness atrocities such as illness, rape, murder, betrayal, heartbreak, injustice, and greed happen to ourselves and others?

u/jaydeeblop,"waiting it out This week I got beat up by my boyfriend again while we were visiting family because I caught him cheating again. He has since took our children to visit his family before the holidays are over. Ive been in bed crying, not sleeping, not eating or drinking, not even having to use the bathroom or anything for a week now. Ive just been laying here feeling like my soul left my body. And Im honestly ready to rid myself of this flesh prison, I just worry about if one day when theyre older will my kids will hate me for feeling like I gave up on them. Even in death I wouldnt want them to feel like I abandoned them for making a permanent choice like this. And being a mother is absolutely everything to me in this world, but my life has been so downright horrendous (childhood and adulthood rape, incest, homelessness, no parents, no real family, no friends, child abuse and neglect, no support, and as an adult being daily constantly verbally, financially, and especially physically abused and cheated on) that I feel like I have to let myself go. Im tired of being tired. Im tired of being hurt. Im tired of waking up every day and living with the fact that I am a shell. Tired of waking up and wishing I never woke up again. But knowing Im stuck being too much of a coward to end my suffering. And stuck wondering will the end of my suffering be the beginning of my childrens suffering.  Up until now the love I have for my kids has helped me maintain. I know the only people Id hurt by doing this are my kids.

Never in my whole life have I kissed any girl on the mouth, much less have I had sex and never has a girl kissed me on the cheek or hugged me, it is something very sad because many people around me have had their first kiss and They had a girlfriend, even the lucky ones had their first time at a very young age like 13 and 14 and when I was that age I was the only one in the classroom who had never had a girlfriend or had their first kiss and I remember it. that every time I heard one of my friends talk about her first kiss or losing her virginity or her first time, I couldn't help feeling a lot of sadness and envy for them and I tried to lie that I had had my first kisses too. and I had had sex with a girlfriend, but they knew I was lying because I am a failure that a girl has never fallen in love with me in all my life and no girl has ever kissed me, it is sadness and misery, I also suffered bullying, I They insulted me, they insulted me, they stole my lunch box, my money and they took my soda and they rejected me and ignored me, I wish one day to meet my bullys again for some things that I will not mention, because they ruined my life, I also wish someday kill myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rtsbpm/i_never_had_a_girlfriend_and_i_never_gave_my/,rtsbpm,1.

u/[deleted],"Memento Mori Yeah, sorry for the cheesy Latin phrase, but today, I'm in a too philosophical state to actually write like a normal human being...and I maybe took too much pain killers.

Well, to the point of my point before I dive into a deep talk about how fucking unfair life is, and that everybody dies, no matter what, I want to make one thing clear: I just really want to pass away on the stop right now. It's not like this feeling is there for a few moments or hours, it's there constantly. For a few months now and after Christmas, it's gotten worse and worse.

Yesterday, I had a breakdown after celebrating New Years Eve with my family - mother, grandma - and again, I was reminded that my family is broken. Every year, it's the same: we cry and grieve for the things we have lost because we can't cope with it. Now, I have come to the decision that the best way for my family is just my leaving. I will try to OD tonight because nothing seems to get better and I do not want another year of suffering. I don't want another year of hospital visits and diagnosis, of crying myself to sleep because of my chronic pain, I just want to die. Ive been manipulated, abused, bullied, I almost died last year...everything just sucks man.

I hugged my mom a few minutes ago, and thinking that this might be the last time I can hold her just breaks my heart..because I don't want to leave her, but I know it's best if I do. I'll finish writing my suicide note and then take all the pills I have (iron supplements, aldactone, maybe some blood thinners) I don't know if it will end or if i just wake up tomorrow and think ''shit'' or if I just die in my sleep...I hope I do that though. 

Still, I am thinking about what if I don't die then? My mom will find out and shell be sad too...I tried to od myself a few years ago too, and it didn't work out. If I fail, my life will shatter more and more and if I die, my mom's life will...I know that..because she told me that. And I kept going and going, but I just can't do this anymore and I'm so fucking sorry for this shit. I won't go into too much detail but without her, i would be six feet under the ground below already. She helps me so much in life and i still think I am not worthy enough to have a mom like this because I am a fucking disappointment. Not only the sick but also the trans family member who no one really cares except two people - her and my grandma. And while writing this, I may consider trying to not do it tonight,,,but the urge to is so strong. I just want to be painless, that's all I want. I want to be a normal human being, not a fucking test rabbit they can use for science. I want to work and have a healthy relationship, but no one wants to date a fucking cripple.

u/Joyce0604202,"I don't want to be alive anymore  This is going to be a long message. I've been acting like everything is alright, like I'm fine and that I have this perfect life, when i truly want to die and I am addicted to self-harming. I created this account on Reddit so I  could talk anonymously because keeping it a secret is really, really  hard now. So for anyone who cares, this is how my life has been. I am a 19-year-old girl and a med student. I've been abused by my  parents since I was born. My mom always impressed me with her different  ways of making me be in pain. She used to undress me, leaving just my  underwear, drag me in the shower, turn it on with freezing water, and  start to beat me with anything she could find on the way (but most of  the time, it would be with a kitchen utensils or her hands and later on I  understood that when you are cold, everything hurts more so that's why  she used the cold water). She would also drag me around the house by my  hair, like if she was cleaning with me. She knew I loved animals, that I was very sensitive when I watched animals being tortured so, idk why, she would regularly make me sit in front of her computer, open YouTube, and make me watch animals being slaughtered. When i tried to go away because I was scared and crying my ass off, she would make me sit back and tell me that this was how life was and that i couldn't avoid it or run from it. The list can continue for so long:  throw me at the stairs, choke me with my clothes, beat me and if I tried to protect myself by contracting my muscles, she would wait until I stopped tensing them to continue, wash my mouth with soap when i said something she didn't like etc etc. And she also insulted me every single day. She used to tell me that I was fat, and that if iwas not skinny, then nobody would ever love me because “nobody wants to marry a fat person” (this is why I have been living with bulimia and anorexia and I feel guilty every time that I eat). She told me that if I was not the best student, she wouldn't consider me as her daughter, and she would hang me on a tree. She told me I was stupid, she didn't allow me to have friends, she would mock my dreams, and she treated me as a servant. My dad would just see my mom do these things to me and wouldn't say anything. For him, this was her way to educate me. 

 When my parents got divorced and my mom abandoned me, I was 13 and so i stayed with my dad. I told myself that because she wasn't there anymore, things were going to be better. But of course, i was wrong and stupid.  My stepmom appeared, and her turn came to abuse me. She killed my cat  with poison, gave my turtles without telling me, and she would make  jokes about killing my dog. This is when things really started to get  ugly with my dad too. She told my dad that he should be more violent  with me, that I was a spoiled brat and didn't deserve anything. She  would make fun of my health (I have a weak immune system so most of the  time I'm sick) and tell me how was i  
 suppose to have sex with someone if couldn't even practice sport because of my weak health. She told me nobody gave a fuck about me and that i was going to be alone for the rest of my life. She told me I was a  parasite, a fraud, that even my mom abandoned me and made fun of the  fact that i self-harmed and told me that i was so useless, that i wasn't even able to properly kill myself. My dad was there when she  told me this, but as usual, he didn't do shit. I was so scared that I went to see the police and ask for protection. They gave me protection and there was a trial where I had to prove that she was abusing me. My dad was a witness and when  they ask him if he could say what my stepmom used to tell me, that if he  could say if what i was saying was true, he lied to protect her. He told the jury that she just told me to fight for my dreams and that i was intelligent enough to be whatever i  
 wanted to be. How can a dad do that???? I was crying so hard, and he still continued to lie. When the trial was done, i was still crying, and he dropped me in a McDonald and left to go with  my stepmom. I had to go back to my house by foot (it was raining). My  dad always tells how much he hates me and that i am the reason his  life is miserable. My stepmom moved and even if my dad hasn't moved in  with her, he's never at home, I'm always alone hurting myself and when  he is at home, he just tells me how much he hates me over and over  again. I spent Christmas and new year alone in my room, just with my dog  while my neighbors got this insane family reunion and icould hear them laughing together. 

This is just a summery of my life, i skipped a lot of things, but honestly, i just want to die. There is no reason for me to keep fighting. I don't have a mom, my dad hates me, i do have some friends but i  
don't talk with them about my problems. I just want to fall asleep  forever. I believe in God, but why has life been so unfair for me, what  did ido wrong? Why i get to suffer when other people have a perfect stupid life? Life is unfai r, and i hate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rtuktk/i_dont_want_to_be_alive_anymore/,rtuktk,1.

u/ReyUsesReddit,"I’m a horrible person I attempted twice in the last years. My friends in my sibling know, but my parents don’t. I’m not in therapy or something like that. After my last attempt in April I stoppt making plans to die and looking for locations and methods. My will to die just kind of died with it. I speak kind freely about my depression with the people that know about it. The person I talk about it with the most is my 16 yo younger sibling. At first I was hesitant to tell them anything because I didn’t want to traumatize them to become like I am. They always pressed me to talk about what’s going on inside my head and assured me that they could take it or would tell be before it becomes to much. 
But today they told me that I need to go to therapy because they can’t take it any more. I realized I became too comfortable talking about my suicidal thoughts and I hurt them. They say thy feel like our relationship to each other has become toxic and I kind of agree. 
I don’t know how to get therapy. I tried several times, but it’s to complicated. 
I don’t like that I have these thoughts, but I often think that it’s pathetic that everyone feels more hurt my my depression and suicidal thoughts than me. I can’t explain it really well, but having the option to die gives me comfort. Like I always have a backup plan/easy way out. I don’t feel like I need to get better. I am really good in school, mostly because I am depressed and suicidal. I rather have good grades, make my parents proud and have the option to just end it than to loos that just to try to get better. 
But I love my sibling so much and I don’t want to hurt them more. But I don’t have the strength to help myself. I wish I would die from natural cause/external factor so I’m not the murder of my siblings big sister but still can be dead.

u/BrieflyEndless,"So Tired Yet again I’ve fastened a slipknot to hang myself and have spent the last few nights crying on the floor in my room. The disgust and shame I feel for existing is unbearable. This last month has been the worst month I’ve had in years. I can’t be convinced my friends actually care. They only don’t want to feel bad about themselves when I finally do it. The only reason I’ve stuck around is that tiny sliver of hope of things I could be missing out on, but if there were any good things in my future, I don’t deserve them. 

I feel so lonely all the fucking time. I have a few online friends, but no one in person, and my online friends don’t talk to me as much anymore. My lack of friends is just a testament to how pathetic of a being I am. And I’m such a shitty friend too. The only real thing I’ve ever wanted for myself is to be a good person. But how could I be when I’m in this state. I’m faulty. I admit it, I’m a leech, clingy, toxic even. I cling to my friends and sap them for any sympathy they have. They’re all that I have. It’s unfair to them. So I only end up hurting everyone around me. It’s proof I’m a burden. I still try to respond to people on this sub, trying to make my existence somewhat useful and ease people of pain that I’m also feeling, but now I’m just starting to feel empty and bitter.

I don’t know why I’m here. I can’t manage to do anything during the day and responsibilities are steadily piling up. I’m just a worthless, autistic, tranny piece of shit.

I’ve been dealing with some emotions and events recently and it’s honestly driving me insane. I’ve changed so much to the point where I am scared of myself and I know what I am capable of.

I am in no way saying I’m a danger to other but just to myself honestly. I have so much emotions in me that my coping skills aren’t working. Plus I can only listen to music for so long.

u/Vincisomething,"Don't have suicidal urges now but sometimes think about it for the future... I'll probably get over it until I hurt my own feelings in the next 24 hours lol. Mostly venting and crying in the club rn.

Never had any guys interested in me, despite having friends and other people like me. If my friends appreciate me and other people seem to like me, it must mean that there is something fundamentally wrong with me that just makes me unwanted and not attractive (not just in a physical sense although that's part of it) enough to be in a relationship.

There was a time I worked on my self esteem and confidence, but there's a point where self love is pointless if you're never noticed and no one cares to even look at you. I know people say romantic relationships aren't more important than friendships or relationships aren't everything, but what is the point if everyone seems to be more fulfilled by their romantic relationships. I'm not trying to say ""I'm so awesome and people don't appreciate me."" I could spend years on self love and working for the life I want to become the best version of me, but the best version of me may never be enough for anyone.. 

I appreciate and love my friends, but this type of relationship will be the best I get. And even then, all my friends are going to have their own families eventually. What am I going to do, third wheel them and their husbands? Hang out with them when they go out on family night with their kids? Of course, being in a pandemic doesn't help with social interactions, but I can't really use that as an excuse for the past 28 years of my life. Sometimes things aren't just meant for people like me and I just need to accept it. Instead of wasting the next 40+ years of my life hoping for something that may never happen, I've had the thought of just ending it if I can't get anyone by the time I'm 30 (29 in March). 

Even shitty and abusive people can manipulate people into a relationships. They shouldn't obviously (and people that are trash like that should be kicked into an active volcano), but even as someone who was on the other end of emotional abuse, I can't help but think that there must be a reason that even awful people can find someone and I can't.

Do I really want to delude myself with false hope and end up being 70 with the same exact realization I did when I was in my 20s? I already know things like this aren't for me so why would I subscribe to the belief that things will get better in the future. It's like ""oh wow now I'm 30 and I'm at the same exact conclusion I did 2 years ago. Let me see if the next 10 years will be different- Oh it's not? I'm so glad I convinced myself that things will work out as long as I'm patient, become the best version of me, and live my life to the best of my ability /s"" I'd rather just accept that it will never happen earlier in my life than lie to myself or live some delusional fantasy for the next 50 or so years of my life.

At this point I don't know how serious I am about it, but it's going to be pretty pathetic when half my life has gone by and I realize I'm still not in a relationship. Not because of a lack of self worth, not living my best life, or whatever else people say you need to do, it's going to be because I'm just not meant for other people and I should've stopped trying years ago but i was stupid enough to think it would change.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rtzqqv/dont_have_suicidal_urges_now_but_sometimes_think/,rtzqqv,1.

There’s so much that has happened it’s honestly so hard to put into text. 
All I know is that I’m 24 years old (M) and I am exhausted. It feels I live many lives before. I wake up tired. That’s not normal, but the only way I think of making it better is ending things. 
I have no money, soon out of a job and place (staying in a hotel room at my job; which is also very expensive. $35/night even though I’m paid part time at 9/hour).

It may all be moot anyways, her mother won't let me see her, or have anything I give her, so when I'm gone... Maybe put it all in a bond or a trust or something until she turns 18. 

Need to figure out how to get some of my stuff to her when she turns 18. There is no doubt in my mind she'll be better off without me, watching me struggle and fail. 

I've struggled with these feelings since I was a child. 2 friends killed themselves this last year. my life work has been a complete waste.

This time of year is always really hard for me. On January 5th 2019 I had to put my cat down. He was my only reason for living for so long and to lose him is still a blow that I haven't completely come to terms with. Say what you want about pets and animals being stupid, but he was my everything and I was everything to him. God, just thinking about having to put him down makes me want to bawl like a baby...but it needed to be done. He was 19 years old, his organs were failing, and when we took him to the vet for the last time he weighed around 3 pounds...just nothing but skin and bones. He was run down and ready to go...but as always he purred at me right up until the end. Fuck, I just miss him so much.

Anyway our current oldest cat (aptly dubbed ""Fat Kitty"", for very obvious reasons) is about ready to go too. She has cancer and I know that this will most likely be her final year alive, if not just a few more months. I've had her since she was a tiny little kitten, 16 years ago we got her. She's a bitch to the other cats, always has been and always will, but I can't help but love her. It just hurts to know that she'll be leaving soon, she's been there for me through some of the hardest times in my life.

The early year just seems to signal that a cat will die. In 2017 it was my 19 year old cat's brother, Simba. I was on some strong anti psychotics at the time and don't remember too much (all I did for a little over a year was sleep and walk around like a zombie, I have little to no memory of this time as well), only that he also purred until the end. I loved him too, but his death just didn't hit me as hard for some reason, probably because of the meds.

So right now I'm just depressed as fuck and just want to scream into the void until my throat starts to bleed. I've been working on writing, but earlier I nearly lost it while working on it and nearly hucked my notebook across the room in frustration. I just feel so done right now and the year has barely even fucking started. I just want to find a hole to hide in until January ends, just so I don't have to feel anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading this, if you didn't read all of it I totally understand. I just needed to get it out before I lost my mind and did something I'd end up regretting (probably cutting again, which is also a hard subject to talk about when I'm in the moment). I just really want a hug right now, but I'll just settle for any affection at this point. Everything just fucking sucks right now and I just want to fast forward to March when there are no death anniversaries in sight until the summer.

u/Unlikely-Gift-4843,"Tired Why is it for a few short moments the pressure lifts only to descend and crush any spark of hope. I am so over everyone and everything.  My psychiatrist is away for 7 weeks and I stupidly promised to hold off on ending things until he can talk face to face in February. Possibly he may have kept me in hospital if I had not. As it was I spent a week there as he tried to adjust meds and improve sleep. Of course I can simply break the promise but my brain does not work that way. To me it is one thing I have done right in my stupid life, keep promises. 

Fuck everything.  
I am almost prepared as getting finances and home in order. Have set up all bills to be paid for 12 months.  That way my husband will be okay for the first year while he gets used to me being gone. I still have to make an appointment and get my will updated. This happens in the next two weeks.  

Have researched my chosen method. Should be fine. As before fuck everything I am so tired of keeping going. Funny thing is I am fooling everyone about the way I feel.

I have vented about some of my traumas and my suicidal thoughts to them, and they want to help me. But I don't feel comfortable talking to them anymore. I can't hide my feelings from them, they know how I feel, but I can't talk to them about it because I don't want to continuously force my own baggage onto them. I don't want to use my friends as therapists. But I can't afford once because I am in thousands of dollars of debt and work a job that doesn't offer healthcare benefits, so I can't get a therapist. I live paycheck to paycheck as it is. I'm pretty sure I have at least one mental illness, but I don't want to self-diagnose. I continuously feel the desire to ask my friends for help, but I have a stronger feeling that if I continue down this path I will lose the only things keeping me alive by pushing them away. The worst part is that I think I'm becoming a bit too attached to them too. These are the first few people in years who have offered me legitimate support outside of simple platitudes and phrases like ""it could be worse"". So in return I constantly feel the desire to be around them. This constant feeling of wanting to be with someone, but not wanting to annoy them, but them being my only support, but fearing they talk about me behind my back about what a horrid person I am and how clingy and annoying I can be, it's tearing me apart inside. I wish I had never spoken to them, so that they didn't have to be burdened by me.

I am not taking the coward’s way out. That would imply I didn’t fight, and I didn’t try.

List of things I have tried:

1. Start the process of getting professional help for my health issues
2. Take constant prescribed medication for depression and anxiety
3. Keep myself busy with hobbies
4. Give my full effort at work
5. Do my best to make people I care for happy
6. I called the crisis prevention hotline
7. I tried group therapy
8. I opened up communication with my old friends
9. Draw/ write about my feelings
10. Watch videos that used to make me happy

Nothing makes me happy anymore. Life has shown me no matter who promises what, in the end we all have our own best interests in mind. I now have my own interests in mind. I was not given another chance to be the little happy girl loved by everyone.

u/Sam_777_p_B,"Need support Hi. I’ve been struggling with mental health issues for a while now. I can’t believe that It’s gotten as far as me posting on social media for help, but here I am. I just want to talk to someone who might have the same thoughts that I do. Lately I’ve been plagued by the thought that I have no purpose and that life is meaningless. It really makes me crazy to think about it. I’ve also been feeling like I’m going insane lately because I do this thing, this embarrassing thing that I can’t believe I’m sharing on the internet, where I basically pretend that my characters (I write a lot) are real and I talk to them and pretend they’re next to me. Sometimes it scares me how real it seems. I also have this beach in my mind that I spent a lot of time in before school ended for break. It’s almost like there’s a second me in my head that I can jump into whenever I need to escape. I don’t know. Maybe I’m going crazy. I just hope someone else out there maybe experiences these same things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ru2z75/need_support/,ru2z75,1. Seeking help and support

u/ashyemmett,"Should I see a doctor? I’ve had two nervous breakdowns in one day, I don’t want to return to work since I had a breakdown and was sent home early. I’ve spent the last 24 hours either super drunk or super high but now I’m sobering a little but now there’s a massive headache which I think is from dehydration? But also yesterday I hit myself numerous times in the head with a crowbar and a hammer, especially in the temple area. There weren’t any headaches after I hit myself so I don’t think anything is wrong. I hit myself so I could punish myself for being such a stupid coward and my mom use to hit me when I was younger if I misbehaved so I feel like whenever I do something wrong, I have to be physically reprimanded lol.

However my headache is really bad, I feel drunk, and my ears are ringing. Also hospitals cost money and I don’t want to be in the psych ward so I’m debating just laying on the ground until the headache goes away, or if I’m lucky and it turns into a fatal brain bleed and I die. And hey if it’s permanent damage, I did this to myself so I should probably just die anyways. I’m feeling sleepy but also restless because I guess my head is stupid. Hehe. Or maybe the world will continue to spin.

Either way I don’t plan on doing anything else in life except die. Just working up the courage to purchase a shotgun in the next few days. Well my headache and my sinuses feel bad so I’m going to probably fall asleep and, fingers crossed, not wake up.

u/DumbDumbProductions,"I feel so numb First post here, as far as I can remember. It’s 3:52 am right now. I’m 18F. Graduated high school a few months ago, went straight into college. I shouldn’t have. I really shouldn’t have. I desperately needed a gap year but I never would’ve been allowed to have one. My parents are homophobic and I’m not out to them. I recently found out I’m bi. I don’t feel capable of loving. Yes, I know how that sounds. My first boyfriend was in middle school and he hit me. Second was four years after and he lied to me. I’m just done with it. 

I want to die. So bad. I haven’t cut myself yet but it’s getting harder and harder to stave it off. I’ve struggled with depression for years - a third of my life, just feels like it was ripped away from me. Stolen. I tried to tell them… but they ignored me. I wanted to kill myself in 10th grade but I pussied out. 

I genuinely have stopped believing I’ll live a long life. That I’ll kill myself before my thirties. I feel like I’m drowning constantly. I want out of this but I don’t know if I have the strength to end it myself. I hope a truck just fucking runs me over one day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ru5syu/i_feel_so_numb/,ru5syu,1. Seeking help and support
u/Thiccius_,"I want to die I want to die 

I want to die but I can’t, every single time I try to cry for help , doesn’t matter if I take dramatic measures to be heard. I’m left ignored. Every single day I live in a world where my parents don’t love and respect me. I tell dad my struggles and he says he understands but he yet again he keeps doing what I told him not to do, things that hurt me. I tried to kill my self and I told him what he was doing drove me into madness. Yet when I come back. He hasn’t changed. He says I’m weird, he says the things I do are weird, the things I like, the way I’m acting… all weird in his mind. He sees me as slave and something he HAS to take care of. He doesn’t want to but he has to. He tells me that every single week. He has said that I made my dads younger life non existent. Like if it was my fault. Yet I don’t have any child hood. It all has shattered to pieces by now. I tell mom that she doesn’t have to treat me like child. Even tho my room is messy, my body unwashed, the garbage not picked up, and my homework not done. Ik how to do all of those things. But I’m to burned out and depressed to do any of it. And mom (and dad) thinks throwing money and pills at the problem will fix any of it. Mom has drag me and Abbie through hell. First she left me and Abbie, she let Tim take her away, she made us live with Scott, the person who had pointed a gun at me saying if I cry anymore or tell anyone of what he was doing we would kill me in drunken frustration. The person who’s little brother raped my little sister. The person who has hit me multiple times, the person saying my mom killed her self because I was too much, Or she ran away, or died. Then drew, first he was nice and kind then the more he was around us the more he started to get comfortable at yelling at us. Then one day he told me i was worthless. Saying that I’m a deadbeat, or a no good, or that I’m just never going to survive with out him. He said he was sorry but yet treats me like shit, I told mom what he was doing was wrong but just keep saying it’s what I deserve. I want to die but I can’t. I have responsibilities that actually need to up hold. Like nev, making she’s ok. Or making sure Abbie is ok. I want to end my life so bad it doesn’t make sense.

Now a-days I’m waking up to a fight because my burned out ass can’t wake up because I used the night prior as free time because it’s the only time I don’t have to worry about anything. Even tho I still do. Then I go to school, I fall asleep in multiple classes, and vent draw all the time. I’m scared to vent draw because I feel like I would need a separate note book that no one is aloud to see in. In deer that the one I love most will see and think different of me. Like the demented fantasy’s I have. My mind is scary even for me. I want it to stop. Anyways I end up liking school more than home because I have no real conflicts at school. Every time I come home or maybe later on that night. I feel hostility in my heart. I need to defend my self. Ik I snap a lot and I don’t mean too it’s just hard because I feel always on edge. Then at night. Where nev isn’t there anymore and I’m by myself in my own cryptic mind. Where I find my self stuck within rabbit hole of where I start thinking that I should kill my self. No one is stopping me. I could end it at anytime tonight. Wanting to end my life is a draining day to day task that I carry. All the damn time I feel hopeless. Like nothing is getting better. I mean it is since Nev is around. But I want everything to end. 

I want my mom and dad, hell even my step parents to love me. They say they do but it’s because they have to love me. I don’t understand why. They have no respect for me. It’s because I’m the child and they have the “social hierarchy” for parents as their kin. The parents are the kings and queens and the children are the peasants. “It’s because I said so” or not giving me a reason why I have to do something. Like I just want to know that’s all. But yet they have to disrespect to just treat me like I’m an extension of them. Not a separate human with my own conscience.  It’s tiring of being a slave tbh. Not the right choice of words but who ever reading this probably gets the memo. 

Mom and dad tend to get defensive when I say something is wrong instead of hearing me out the bring excuses to my table to show how it’s my fault instead of theirs. Everything is my fault as my step mom likes to say. I hold all accountability for what happens in my life. Dad says it’s a “southern way of thinking” or something along those lines. I mean yah somethings are like getting a fender bender or hitting someone or committing tax fraud. But when it’s my brain vs everyone and everything in existence. I don’t think so. When I bring something up it’s like talking to a brick wall. Even tho Ik it won’t work. I still try. 99.99% unsuccessfully. But at-least I can say I tried. I’m told my parents are tired of my excuses. But I’m tired if theirs. 

At the end of the day I can right more and more of why I’m “victimizing my self” as dad like to frame it. But if they say “I never said that” their the problem. Not me. 

As of right now I broke my girlfriends heart. And I feel horrible. She is the last person that loved me. Because of my own over bearing stress. I snapped and broke her heart. 

So at the end of the day. If things don’t get better quickly I’ll end my life",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ru5vrg/i_want_to_die/,ru5vrg,1. Seeking help and support

u/Aware_Still3979,"Destroyed mentally, physically and emotionally. I feel like the world wanted me dead from the start. Do you guys ever feel like, the world wants you to die? That everything around is out to get you? Well that's the kind of paranoia I have nowadays. I find it hard to believe in anything anymore.

The past few years have been difficult. In late 2019, I had an emotional breakdown and was also nearly failing a lot of classes. And when things started to look better. 2020 happened. It sucked being at home with negative people, and the arguments. 2021 was going good until the final half, where I was pretty much alone for all of it. It was probably the first time I really did just sit and each lunch alone. I didn't even bother going off campus even though I can as a senior. I'm a senior with barely anyone to fucking hang out with. 

I lost every online friend I had. Which was most of my friends in the first place. 

And after all of this I still kept trying at least a little bit. 

I run a 10,000 subscriber youtube channel. But I'm tired. I realize how unhappy I am doing this. Having to edit videos feels tedious. I realized how fucking unhappy I've been for the past 2-3 years. 

but I don't know how to be happy. I don't know what will really significantly make me happier. 

I don't want to quit because it's my only hobby. I don't really have much freedom to go outside anyways. Going to school is the only real time I interact with other people. 

I'm fucked up from being sheltered my whole life, and I don't know how to be around people. I already don't fit in and the way I was raised didn't make it easier. 

I'm nearly an adult and I feel like a fucking joke. A fucking child. Not the normal type of way people feel when they are about to graduate but I feel like I fucking idiot. An idiot who wasted everything. Barely any friends, I barely want to interact with anyone, and it doesn't even matter because I don't trust anyone in my life cause I'm a paranoid idiot. 


I just don't know what to do anymore. And I spent minutes, staring at my discord, looking for someone to talk to. And I realize that no one had time to deal with me, or my fucking bullshit anymore.

Hell it feels like there is more benefits to me being dead then there are me being alive. My parents would seperate instead of arguing. My dad would be free of all the shit he has to pay for to keep me alive, and having to pay for my mom's crap. No one would have to hear me rant or vent anymore. No one would get frustrated or angry with me because I can't do basic things.

Hell, I've thought about jumping into traffic. But if I share that, I apparently get locked away like a crazy person. So I have to keep to myself, shut up, and be alone. 

Sometimes I don'tmind be alone. But I have fucking people telling me that it's sooo good I'm independent. I'm just fucking tired of having hours to myself. I hate it. I hate that I spend it on youtube, trying to be funny and put on some stupid act where I yell a lot and try to pretend I'm happy. I hate that I spend hours editng and doing stuff I don't even like. I hate how separated the whole world is from me, and in general. I hate the way the world is. I just don't see any point other than keeping my dad and other people from being sad. 

But why do I have to sacrifice myself to keep other people from feeling sad? It feels like my whole life I've been sacrificing I want for others. Letting go of things, being other people's doormat, being taken advantage of for stupid jobs, like I was for a few months in 2021. 

It's not fucking fun being an only child, with no friends, parents who can't be there, yet sheltered me in the house for years. Online friends who have moved on. 

And it feels like no one in the fucking world can understand how I feel because I'm different from everyone else around me physcially, mentally and emotionally. 

It's a fucking miracle I haven't killed myself yet or gone insane. 

But I'm so....so fucking tired. I'm tired of killing myself over fucking youtube. I can literally feel myself getting scoliosis and my spine is getting worse. 

I guess the truth of it all, after writing all of this. Is that I really fucking hate the way my life is. Because most of it was out of my control from the fucking start. I suffered through years of my parents bullshit arguing, my dad even regrets it deeply keeping me around my mom. But it doesn't make up for the fucking damage. I didn't choose where I live, and I didn't choose to be the only kid in the school with dark skin for the first 6 years I lived here. I didn't choose to not fit in. I didn't choose to be only child. And I didn't choose any of this shit.

The only reason I even exist is because someone wanted fucking money, so they stayed with a military man and tried to get as much as she could out of him. 

I feel fucking crazy believing ""the whole world has it out for me"" But I genuinely feel like the world wants me dead. That the plan god has for me is to die young.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ru6bbm/destroyed_mentally_physically_and_emotionally_i/,,1. Seeking help and support

u/Deltaoctober,"Happiness feels wrong I fucking hate my OCD. As soon as I get a hold on one obsession it immediately shifts to something else that causes panic. I've recently developed existential OCD. I needed to know what is right and what is wrong, what I should follow, how to live, what's the right way of thinking etc. I've studied so much philosophy since it started and I'm exhausted. I've found myself delving deeper and deeper into more pessimistic philosophies. I panic everyday that they might be right and I hate it. I don't want them to be right. But now every time I'm happy there's something in my head telling me no it's not right to be happy and death is better and I shouldn't enjoy life. It feels like I'm on the floor battered and weak. And whenever I find the strength to try and get off the ground someone behind me smashes my head with a bat to keep me down. I don't just want to be happy, I want to be right.  I have an intense fear of becoming delusional. I want to be realistic as possible but I also want happiness.

 I'm considering just ending it soon as it seems the morally correct thing to do. According to what I've read. I don't want to die but it seems like I should. I don't know how I would yet. Either jump off a bridge or buy a gun with my next paycheck and do it that way. I don't know yet. I need to look at my options. I'm so tired. I haven't had a comfortable sleep in a while.

u/IIRayRavenII,"I'm Giving Up I've made so many mistakes in my life and everything's finally out of my control. I've lost most of my family, I sit at home all day and do nothing besides when I'm working. I'm in the middle of a divorce with the woman I gave my heart to, I'm gonna lose so much time with my daughter when custody is decided. The worst part is, it's genuinely all my fault. I cheated, I didn't care about everyone else when I should. I caused my wife to end up genuinely hating me. My motivation to do anything has slowly been draining away since she moved out and took my one year old daughter with her. I wake up at night looking for them only to remember they're gone and better off without me. I'm literally on the verge of tears just sitting here typing all of this out, it's like I'm admitting everything to myself finally. I have no drive to keep fighting in life. I'm stuck in a job I despise, no motivation to go to college to get into a field that I like, everything is just grey to me now. Even my biggest hobby, video games, is more so a chore now and I barely get joy out of it.

I've finally reached a point in my life where I feel all these doors are closing and locking me into this black room where I'm going to be left to myself, and I'm scared of what I'm going to do when someone finally opens that door. I can't even say I deserve sympathy, y'know? I did everything to myself. I brought all the things I hate upon myself, and it's all well deserved. I think that's the worst part of all of this, I can't seek pity, I can't seek help with it, because in the end it what's happening in my life needs to happen so I can be taught a lesson, or at least there needs to be some consequences for my stupid decisions. 

I want to stop waking up in tears. I've caused so much suffering for the closest people in my life and it's all come full circle. I'm slowly realizing I'll probably never feel true happiness again, nor do I deserve to. The worst part is I can't even bring myself to take any action. I want it to end so badly but I just, can't.

u/Pirantis,"Tired of living I'm tired to pretend everything is going ok in my house. 

I'm tired of everything. I'm tired to fight and never get any positive results. I'm tired of listening always the same speech about how I will improve (no, I won't). I spent the last 10 years doing everything I could and still I'm useless. And one year of therapy didn't make me feel better and didn't improve nothing at all. 

I just wanted a simple life, like a huge proportion of population have. Not wanting a fancy house, to be a boss, to have a huge salary o becoming someone important. I just wanted friends, a romantic parnter, a stable job that don't remember me what a failure I am. Things people get without struggling, just doing their normal life.

There's nobody I just wanted a hug and to feel safe again. If I never started a relationship I wouldn't know what it's like to held just for it to be gone again. I miss it all. I just wanna cry in someone's lap but I'm a guy I can't ask for that. I just choke alot because it's even worth crying over anymore. Absolutely nobody I miss being happy now I'm back in my abusive house because of financial reasons. I just wanna go to sleep but I can't because arguing woke me up now sun's up. I don't even want to wake but I will to pretend I'm happy like normal so I don't worry anyone again. I don't even get hugs from my mom anymore I'm too old I guess. I know though that there's no point in hoping because you then you get your hopes up for nothing. I was literally a mistake that burdened my mom's life and now I'm just lonely. Nobody's gonna see this like usual and I feel like I'm dying inside daily. No matter what I do to make me happy this cloud returns. I just want it all to stop. I miss school and my friends graduation everything got worse than I got sick. I don't even know the point of this it's not like someone can help me but maybe I'll show a therapist if I even get the courage to go back because I ghosted them when they wanted to meet in person. I'm ready for the afterlife and this life is just horrid. Everyone's busy while I'm stuck trying to get happy so I can start my life. Meditation helps but it hurts too reflecting on all my mistakes by myself because theirs nobody. I because my own therapist and even I can see this patient ain't doing too hot. I'm tired,hungry, depressed sad, lonely,broke and mental illness is wrescking me. A wrestling icon of mine said something that just loops in my mind.

On the 8th day
God created Mankind
Why was He having such a bad day?!
Why did He created all of you normal
And forget some of the important parts of me?!
He made the teeth that I swallowed
The ear that was ripped from my skull
A face that no longer exists!!
Deep inside you are merely a mirror image
Of all my atrocities!!
The ugliness that exists outside
Lives inside every one of you!
(sobbing)
Destruction
CAN BE BEAUTIFUL!!!!

I ghost everyone because I’m constantly bombarded with thoughts of intense suicidal ideation. It takes me out for days. I physically cannot respond or even look at messages. I always get the feeling that no one likes me, that they don’t actually want to talk to me, that I’m wasting their time talking to them because they’d rather talk to someone else. God, the constant spiraling of rumination. Rumination. Rumination.

I feel so useless. Empty. Insignificant. I want to do something meaningful, but because of this constant endless rumination I can’t do anything without feeling so drained. 

So I end up just mindlessly consuming. Playing brainless mobile games. Scrolling through social media. Eating takeout. Repeat. Consume. Consume. Just consume. 

By the time I do want to at least talk to somebody, the thoughts come back again. You are worthless. Insignificant. Useless. I ghost them again. The cycle repeats.

u/[deleted],"I'm hopeless I'm absolutely hopeless. I'm 20,I live in a small european city,and I dropped out of high school because of my debilitating depression. I come from a very poor family,and while I regret dropping out,now I have no financial possibility to go back to school,or even take courses and such to be able to find a job. I've been looking for jobs for years,anything,cleaning toilets,babysitting,bartending,anything that was available I tried to apply,but I haven't found anything at all. No one called back but a place that wanted for me to pay them to be trained for months,and I couldn't do it.

All my friends left me since I dropped out. I haven't hung out with a friend in almost 2 years. The only people I have left in my life is my mother and my girlfriend that lives in a whole different continent,and that I may never even be able to marry because to the US I'd be a leeching gold digger since I have no employment history,and if she came here we'd find barely any jobs. She's the only good thing in my life and I'm so close to breaking up with her because she has a job,she's financially comfortable,she has friends and a life and I'm just so fucking tired of feeling like I'm holding her back from a successful life just so that she can be with me.

I have nothing. I can't study. I can't work. I don't have friends. I don't have a car. I'm 4 months late on rent.

Hello, just wanted to tell my story if I really do kill myself today, just turned 18, but to be painfully honest, my life has been spiraling down since I’ve been born. I was raised from a single mother who always isolated herself in the kitchen, smoking and listening to the radio broadcast. Then I got adopted into a kinda foster family and I’m really grateful for them to semi adopt me, but it seems even with their greatest efforts, I’m not gonna make it, not because I have any physical disease or anything in that kind and I’m grateful for that, but I remember as a kid I had a idea to bottle up my emotions, because I was always so sad and angry I made a pact with myself to try bottle up all these emotions, and the emotion debt I have been collecting is killing me from the inside, I feel so hollow like a tree who has it eaten up by mushrooms, nothingness, I have no one to talk to about my experiences or emotions, ideas, dreams, hope, future.

I’m scared shitless, I’ve been humored from everyone making fun at me, even my foster family hates me and makes me the bad example of being an human.

And I know life is choices and you are responsible for your actions to degree, but I feel like screaming and tearing myself to bits, but I feel responsible for everything, I have no one to blame.

I’ve never had a true friend, girlfriend, family, dad, childhood, anything in that regard, and now I have to be an adult, but I feel like a kid inside who still scared shitless from basic human interaction and nobody understands me, I’ve been isolating myself to the point that if I don’t have work or school I just lay down in my bed with vr googles and eat, drink, piss etc.

Is there really any hope for human trash like me? Wouldn’t it be better to take trash out and call quits while everything still hasn’t been totally ruined?

I have an amazing boyfriend of 2 years, and he got me a gorgeous and expensive promise ring. I usually take it off in 2 places of his home because he said it might warp when I sleep with it. So last week I had taken it off and forgot to take it home. I told him about it qnd he said he'll keep it safe. Yesterday was went on a mad search for it because it was nowhere to be seen. He was more panicked than me, and it was killing me inside that my stupid habits created this whole situation. He ended up finding it in the trash, in a bunch of vacuum remnants. 

When he got back inside he held it up to me and said, ""Do you know how much this is worth?"" And proceeded to unintentionally make me feel like the shittiest person ever. He asked if I had anything to say about it and asked if I was going to make this mistake again.

During the time that he had gone outside to dig in the trash, I found his bottle of pills in his drawer, and I thought about taking them all. I felt like disappearing. Lately I haven't been eating much at all. I'm so anhedonic that I could nap for hours during the day. Rooms seem so quiet. My mind feels so loud. I've been thinking of hurting myself for the past 2 weeks, and I've had moments of weakness during then that I want to give in. 

This hasn't even been the worst my life has gotten, but fuck, I feel so empty, I just want to be a pair of shattered bones.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rub1bd/the_smallest_things_make_me_want_to_die/,rub1bd,1. Seeking help and support
u/throwaway61838292,"Probably gonna end it this week, I failed at the game called Life 18yo Male, I got bullied alot in High school so i did't give a shit about my education, dropped out early, no qualifications no self esteem. Never had a gf and hardly ever had friends. Im living with my mother and we have no money we are always on the brink of being homeless. and this time we might be for real,  my mother is behind on rent and has debt. Im way too mentally ill and socially arkward to get a job and even then it would not be enough. Im a huge pussy so i would not survive being homeless, (my only other relatives live in a different country and i have no money to travel)


On top of that im a ugly short poor piece of genetic trash with nothing going for me so i have nothing to lose. Atleast when i die i shall finally have peace.

Honestly this world is a cruel evil degenerate hell hole, i never asked to be put here. Fuck humanity i want out.

u/Arlumium,"Will it ever get better? Hi everyone, is my first time posting in this community, i thought that it might help to write something here, since i don't want to put any of my friends on a tight spot by saying certain things :P  


Long story short: I've been diagnosted with moderate depression recently and i originally planned to end it on the 31st of December. I just wanted my life to end with 2021..  


But as you can guess i didn't have the courage to do it, so i'm still here. I didn't want the people around me go trough something like the suicide of a loved one..  


Good thing is that now that my original plan """"failed"""" i want to push a little further to see if i'll get eny better :P  


My question is kinda straight forward.. will this ever go away?  
Will i ever be able to overcome all this shit, and hopefully not fall in this again?  


My fear is that even if i overcome this now, it will come back to haunt me in the future, so inevitabily will end up killing my self at some point in my life.

u/_blank_soul_,"I think I'll do it soon but I don't want to I'm feeling the same I felt before my first attempt. And then I was happy most of the time but I just snapped and almost cut my throat. Now it's almost the same, I feel ok-ish most of the time but I can't sleep and I feel that pressure in my chest again. I quit drinking but I started smoking more weed. I smoke less cigarettes tho so that's a plus I guess. I've been feeling like this for the past few years but it's been worse I'm just scared I'll lose control again. Last time I just blacked out for an hour or so. I remember grabbing the blade and than nothing until I got out of the hospital. This time I'll try something new tho. I don't really want to right now but the mood swings are unpredictable and I already have a plan. All I need to do is to update my note and stop resisting. But I'm not sure I want to let go just yet. I'll just say it all here and pretend at least one person reads it all. I don't know why I feel this way. I thought it was because I felt lonely but then I got a gf and it wasn't much better. The attempt was during the relationship but not related to it. So that didn't help. I know the relationship became toxic but I still miss that sometimes. And no arguments convinced me so far not to do it. Like I'm not afraid of what's after, I don't care about what I'll miss because I won't know anyway and I don't care if people will be sad after I die because I'll be dead so why bother. I don't really see a point in ending it all but I don't see a good reason to keep living either. The only difference is that I tried to keep going but never tried being dead so the next time my brain gives up I will just hang myself or jump off a building and see where I end up. I don't understand shit and the world seems to be less and less real so I don't feel like I'd lose anything. For anyone that has read all this, thanks .

Sadly my parents have made me the way I am kinda (though most is to blame on myself) for example I am a people pleaser. because of them I let everyone walk over me and I don’t mention some things when talking to people so that I don’t upset them, like asking a question again.

I'm horrible at words and at articulating my thoughts and my overall situation. I'm a gay man that hits 31 in a few months. Have been stuck for a long time with toxic family--religious, homophobic, etc. Raised in a sheltered way is an understatement. I've got no direction. Nowhere to go. I've been battling C-OCD and some other physical health issues as well. 

I met a guy from a dating site that's taken me to a Dr's appointment, out to lunch a couple times. We met in October but talked online since late summer maybe. We've gotten close and so far he only knows of the toxic religious  aspects of my family. He doesn't know that I'm on a low fixed income, and that I don't drive as I've always been terrified of it. Doesn't help that my dad and I had a (though minor) accident when he was driving me around the neighborhood one day, and another car slid into the driver's side of our car, pushing both doors inward. We made it out fine--that was around 2013. Ever since then it's deterred me further away from learning to drive. 

I feel like there's more I'm forgetting here, but I'm terrified of telling him the rest of this stuff. I've felt something for him that I don't think I could be without, and I don't want to chase him off by being honest. I feel like I'm going to be forced to tell him soon but I don't think I could handle what could happen. 

So I've just been thinking about thanking him for the time he's been here for me and just ending myself. I don't want to do that but I fear being alive and not being able to withstand any further aching, or rejection of any sort.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rud7hs/theres_a_bridge_close_by/,rud7hs,1.

u/TheBearJew305,"Wouldn’t it be better if we just weren’t born Oddly I find myself relating with Logan (The wolverine movie) a lot. Because all the time I’m so tired of the mental stress and pain I’m in. But yet I can’t die, I can’t kill myself because people like my parents can’t handle that kind of damage with the already existing problems that causes them to drink. So all the time I live a life for people while I suffer in silence. Because it’s too dark for people to understand the grim reality that I really wish I was never born and wanna die all time. But I don’t because I understand me solving my problem becomes their’s and their dam is already overflowing. I’m so sick and tired of dealing with telling myself I’m never good enough for anything and dealing with this physical illness the doctors can’t figure out that restricts my life so much and makes me miserable that has only worsened with time. And I know eventually if the doctors can’t fix it I eventually will have to kill myself but no body can know that. I’m tired of the endless nights of wanting to cry and feeling worthless and the false hope of happiness because I’ll never be happy with myself. Good luck to you all and thank you for listening

After that I didn’t update just yet because I was taking a break from my phone completely for a while. I’m doing a lot better though :) I’m glad I survived. I’m learning to really enjoy the small things i couldn’t used to. Feeling the sunshine in the morning, breathing fresh air, the taste of everything- it just feels a lot different. I got one of my meds switched while there, which also most likely helped. Thank you everyone for being nice and even reaching out. That made me realize other people cared about my life, which made me think about my family and friends and realized I couldn’t do it. I also decided to give up all drugs but weed since I’d already had to go over a week without them, and that has DEFINITELY helped.

u/throwaway_lifez,"I am tired of this life and I don't fucking know what to do. I knew one day I will be posting here and that day is today. 

Sorry this post will digress a lot from topic to topic, because how cluttered everything feels inside my head, feel free to ignore, just like my friends do. 

I am 28, and non binary. I am studying in a grad school with my parents' money (Yeah, loser am I right?), I am a huge disappointment to myself and to everyone. Recently discovered about myself being enby, and thus having questions of identity in addition to others giving me life crisis. 

 I want to kill myself; I live alone in an apartment near the uni, whose rent is paid by my parents because my fucking rent cannot be paid by just me having one client as a freelancer. I have no friends, everyone seems or just feigns to care, my therapist did not help at all. I work as a freelancer part time, as mentioned above with just one client, and most of the time I am not even acting professionally because I have lost interest in literally everything. Most of my friends(The ones I knew would care) pretend to care, I tell people I am suicidal they fucking tell me to 'think positive'/'other people have it worse'/ 'don't be so negative'. Guess I won't tell you anything at all, nobody is invited to my funeral. I don't have a support system anymore. I feel like I might be having Peter Pan syndrome, imposter syndrome which is already coupled with debilitating anxiety, depression (undiagnosed by my therapist), I am at the breaking point today, the reason I have not killed myself yet is just because my parents still care, but lately my mind has turned on me even more and I fail to see even that most of the times. The other day it took me four hours to even get up from bed, and this is happening during the most busiest time where I have tons of papers and assignments due, I have just no energy to function, physically or mentally. I don't know how to do this, I have been thinking to drop out, but don't feel like doing that just because I have folks who care and have invested in me till this point, however, I still can't talk to them about self harm. I don't know what to do after grad school, nothing gives me pleasure. NOT A SINGLE THING. What's the point of living like this, where I just exist. I have lost all interest in the activities I used to do before, nothing gives me joy anymore. 

I feel very alone in this life. The person I like hanging out with is soon leaving the country, I cannot even express it to them because they are not fond of emotional people getting attached to them, had great time with them these past few months. Most people my age are either married, working, or leaving, my personal life is another hell I want to escape from, which even feeds into my professional life. I have zero confidence in me at this point, I don't know what to do, who to approach to, I feel helpless beyond any point. I want this to end, fuck I don't even have enough courage to kill myself. Waste of space, flesh and blood is what I consider myself. Never had a functional relationship with anyone. I cannot life, I am very tired, I want someone to kill me because I am that pathetic.

u/Ok-Bat-8285,"I don’t know how to help my friend Hi, I (15 m) have a friend (15 f) who has recently been opening up about how they feel like a burden on everyone and feel guilty for living. She told me and another one of our close friends who was the “therapist friend” of the group and he told me that we could try and help her out of whatever she is feeling. As time went on nothing we said or did was helping. Yesterday at 1:55 a.m. I was doing the usual routine of talking with her to see how she is. It got to a point where she told me about goodbye letters she was writing for “when she had to leave”. I started freaking out so I texted the other friend and he said he doesn’t think he’s cut out for this and said he was going to sleep. That left me alone trying to talk her out of suicide because she said she was planning to do it at 3:30 a.m. Eventually she said she would stay another day and as of today I can confirm she is still alive. But I can’t keep doing this. I don’t know what to do because I’m sure some day me talking her out of it won’t be enough. I know her brothers instagram and I could dm him about whats going on but I don’t know how he’ll react or what he’ll do. All I know about him is that they’re close but he and the whole family is very religious and I don’t know how they’re gonna take  it all. According to my friend “they wouldn’t listen if she told them and would slap her with the Bible instead of helping”. I don’t know what to do and don’t know who to contact because I can’t keep doing this alone and it won’t always work. Should i tell someone and if so who should I tell?

*The question I need answered most is if I should tell her brother or not. Because like I said I am very scared at how he will react but I don’t know what else I could do.

P.s. I don’t know if this violates the rules in any way or if this is the right community to post this on but all I know is I need help

P.s.s. We go to the same school but I live in a border town in America and she lives in Mexico so I don’t think calling any local authorities would work.

P.s.s.s. My friend who is has bpd says that the things she has been telling us are identical to what a person with quiet bpd would say. We are far from capable in diagnosing a person but after searching up and looking into quiet bpd, to us it seems she may have this disorder. Which leads me to further believe that simply talking to her won’t be enough and she needs professional help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ruh7os/i_dont_know_how_to_help_my_friend/,ruh7os,1.

Took out his gun, put one in his head

u/[deleted],"I hate myself so much God I can’t stand the way I look in the mirror. I’m a terrible person, and I don’t even remember being awful. I’m fifteen and last year was a hard year for me. I struggled with major self harm, toxic friends, and some family issues. I never wanted to be a bad person, so I always told my friends that if they were ever struggling with something to come and talk to me, and if I say something that makes them upset, to tell me. I used to make a lot of jokes but I tried to not make them feel bad about themselves. Well the other day, my friends told me that I had a bad personality change last year but I’m good now. I’ve always acted like a stupid airhead with my friends because I would forget something and they all thought of my as stupid, well I had enough of that (cuz I started to hate myself more) and I tried to show my actual self, (blunt and hardworking) none the less I always put my friends before me. They were telling me that I was a toxic bitch, and that they were glad I’m back to my “old self”. This completely broke me, and I asked them what I did, but they refused to tell me, and I can’t think of anything.

u/someonewhoisntme666,"So very tired... This will probably be a long one
I'm so tired of trying.
I'm always putting on a happy face to go out and be with friends and family.
I'm trying to get a new job as my last one has finished. It have me some genuinely great times but when I'd get home I always felt the darkness come back.
I can't seem to get my life together for long enough for anything to change.
Everytime I do it's only a matter of time before something happens and it all goes to shit again.

A few months ago I managed to acknowledge some feelings I had for a housemate.
She's lived with me for about two years now and moved in after a pretty brutal breakup.
She would cry in her room and be generally depressed about many things in her life, she weighed about 46kg and looked very under the weather.
After months of helping her and a few years she seems to have made a full recovery.
I enjoy cooking and would always make her dinners and watch tv shows and play games to get her out of her room and stuff and she put weight on and got her confidence back.
I introduced her to my friend group and she made new friends with my friends and I was really happy for her...
Now, I never wanted to have feelings for her as I knew she was emotionally unavailable and she had slept with a few of my friends once she entered the group and it didn't affect me....although she told people explicitly not to tell me and only me which I thought was weird.
Recently, we were on a holiday with the friend group and she slept with somebody it hurt me deeply and kind of made me realise I had very strong feelings for her...and probably did for a while, I just didn't acknowledge it
I got sad and moody and directed some of it at her, which I really regret.
But I wanted to be honest and told her why I was suddenly sad on a holiday which I had been looking forward to all year.
She reacted by completely ignoring me and excluding me from things she was doing, which I probably deserved.
And then the next day she hooked up with another friend right in front of me after knowing how much it hurt me.
Since then my depression has gotten so much worse and I constantly think about suicide...like constantly.
Even when I'm having ""fun"" I'm still thinking about hanging myself.
My house is a total mess and my room is covered in clothes and unorganised junk. (No rubbish, just random crap) 
Tonight she did it again in my house with another friend and it's killing me.

I don't want to ask her to leave but I don't think I can keep watching her get with people whole I have these feelings and I REALLY don't want to talk to her about again, as the last time made me feel like absolute shit.

A part of me thought that we had a special connection and was hoping to see a sign that she wanted more than friendship, but I now know very clearly that is absolutely not the case.
I never made a clear move on her as I'm terrified of rejection after my last few long term relationships ended so badly.

I don't really know why I'm posting here but I feel like I can't talk to my friends or family about it, as the last time I spoke to a very few of my friends they told others and soon enough heaps of people knew about my feelings for her, and made me feel even worse.

I've always struggled with depression but over the last few years I just can't seem to shake it and things like this really fuck me up. 

I know I shouldn't have got feelings and I really didn't want to after past relationships. 
And I know it was selfish of me to want somebody to share those feelings but I really thought there was a chance.

I'm hoping to get a new job soon but I feel like if I don't get it, that will add to it and I'll spiral harder.
I'm on my meds at the moment but they don't seem to work at all anymore.

I hate having to feel envious of WLW couples of having what I'll never have. And my gender dysphoria isn't helping that. I know I'll never be the woman I desire to be. I'm just.. awful. An awful autistic piece of crap. An introvert outcast who deserves death.

And I feel like all my goals are impossible to achieve. I'll never amount to the success that internet artists my age have, even if my skills are just as good or even surpass them. I'm jealous of their success, and their upbringing to get even such a success. 

I hate how I'm always given bad luck. That nothing ever works out for me. Just for other people. I know I'm gonna fail. I know that regardless of how much work I put into my portfolio, I'll still not be accepted to art school for whatever reason. Which'll make me so envious of those who do manage to go.

u/_pro_potato,"Hi Okay so recently i decided take a break with my best friend (and mind, my only friend too). I love her very very much but i felt like we werent able to communicate very good and i saw lots of toxic behaviors and yeah it just didnt work out that well. honestly i feel like she was the only reason i didn’t leave everything cus she helped me through a lot. I even managed to stay clean cus she made me feel like i didnt have to sh. And now that shes gone i literally dont know what to do anymore. Thing is we in the same class and everything so we still see each other everyday at school and it makes it sm harder to deal with. I feel so lonely but at the same time she was also one of the reasons i was really hurting inside. I understand it goes both ways too tho like she probably felt pressured cus of how dependent i was on her. Im not really sure. 
I wanna go back to her and talk about everything again or idk maybe just forget all that happened and move on but i seriously, what do I do? In the beginning i just felt like I wanted to just let it all be and move on but then I relapsed back into my old habits and well shes not here so i dont know what to do anymore. Is it worth going back to her and just deal with whatever happens? Cus being without her i really dont feel like i wanna be here anymore. I know we’re only still in high school but i really saw a future with her and that meant a lot to me since i didnt even thought id be here a year ago.

Today I just snapped. I couldn’t think straight anymore I just cried and cried and went and grabbed a knife. I wasn’t going to go all the way I don’t think I ever could. I’m too much of a coward and too afraid of leaving the emotional pain on others. But I cut myself. The thing is, I couldn’t even draw blood. I couldn’t do that right. But I have these thick scar like lines and a burning sensation on my arm. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to stop feeling like this. I feel so alone. I just I could never tell anyone in my life about this. I’ll be more alone. I’m already getting this awful urge to do it again. I just want to be safe what if I get infected or cut too deep. I sont kbow how to get better. I feel lost, my heart may be beating but i don’t think it’s alive anymore.

I’m scared of myself. I thought i was getting better. Last month I was in the ER for a bad viral infection. I thiufgg I was going to die I couldn’t breathe at all. All I did was think of someone and it gave me the will to hang on. I was greatful to be alive. I had the happiest time of my life in 2021 but it came to an end near the end of the year.

I don't know where I'm heading, and each day I just feel worse and like lazy scum. I can't bring myself to care about what I'm learning, let alone with the rigor and depth that comes with the program I'm in. Every day is the same, I spend hours staring at my computer screen as if I expect my academic expectations to fulfill themselves, and I'm sorry because of it. Eventually, I'll finish what I'm assigned, but I'll feel like I gained nothing from it, because I wasted the whole day. I don't see myself doing anything with my life after this is all over. I've always wanted to be an artist, but I just feel too drained, and it's likely too late to make my passions into a possible career. Everyday I'm exhausted despite not doing shit, and everyday I'm at a constant battle with myself. I don't deserve all the good in my life, I just want to give it to someone else, someone suffering more, wherever they are. Meanwhile, I'll just cease to exist.

They say it is selfish for me to kill myself but I feel like it's the opposite: I think it's selfish for those around me to expect me to suffer so much just so I fill the smallest thing for them in their lives. Just so they can think at some point that I exist and I didn’t die. The fact that I live on in pain while everyone else is happy doesn’t matter to anyone. The very act of living is just enough so that the guilt everyone else feels of my possible death is avoided. Every time I admit to feeling pain it's just others saying that “it will get better” or “just keep holding on”. But that’s just their own selfish way of telling me that while they don’t necessarily care about my wellbeing they just need to avoid the guilt that they will feel should I die.

But through continuous past trauma resurfacing over and over again Im finding it incredibly hard to cope. I don't enjoy doing anything I used to do; I try and I try but I don't feel anything. Im dying inside and hardly anyone knows. I have a family that loves me, but no longer do I look forward to anything these days. Pain, lethargy, crippling anxiety, dread, depression follow me around all day. I've been hardly sleeping. My life for the last 4 years has consisted of multiple traumatic experiences followed by long periods of grief, never fully being able to recover. I feel so completely broken and empty. A heart that used to be so warm and affectionate is turning completely cold and apathetic. I'm the type that would do anything to help another, but I seem to never get the help I so desperately need. I can never seem to get a break. This entire experience has crippled me. I don't mean for this to sound like a pity party but I'm not enjoying life whatsoever. Im turning completely antisocial, isolating myself, overeating, having suicidal thoughts on a minute to minute basis, thinking about death incessantly, losing connection to my spiritual practices that once brought me some solace, feeling dissociated from reality, feeling and communicating like a zombie. I work maybe 2x per week because there is no business. I used to be a bright light for others at work, now it's becoming so hard for me to even speak to my coworkers. I know no one can fix this, but I'm losing hope. Its hard to imagine me living another 5 years if it's going to continue like this.

u/LosingSanity86,"Just need someone to hear me out. Hi everyone. I am a 35 year old male. Lately I have been losing hope and feeling increasingly suicidal. Right now is no exception.

I am not sure where to begin. I feel like such a whiny bitch considering, objectively, my life is fine. If we look at material things... I have a good job, I am buying my first home, and I don't really have any ""actual"" problems.

I have been getting increasingly depressed the past year. It began around the same time COVID did. My job at the time, I feel, took advantage of the situation. Temporary salary cuts, with everyone having to work more. For context, I work in IT. I was doing 11-14 hour days and was burned out.

To circumvent this, I moved across the country and got a new job at the beginning of 2021. I moved with my fiancee. It is worth noting that she was in the same position at her job, so she got a new one as well. She was also being overworked and had her salary cut.

Everything was fine temporarily. The move was stressful but now I feel we are worse off than before. She has grown increasingly depressed as well. I make decent money at my job, but I am not really challenged, and I'm bored. I also feel that I'm not really respected there and don't fit in with the majority of my coworkers, minus 1, maybe 2.

The past year or so, more so, the past 6 months, there has really been no love in our relationship. I, maybe wrongly, feel that I am at least partially responsible for her happiness and I am not delivering. We bought a house together, and are planning for our lives, but I feel that no matter what I do, I will never make her happy. She has been very distant, short with me, quiet, and unaffectionate. She just started on antidepressants. We rarely have sex, and when I try to be affectionate I am just met with, ""I don't have energy to be affectionate right now."" I know that we are both depressed, but I guess I feel like we should at least be depressed together and work as a team to get better. Whereas she seems to want to distance herself and do her own thing.

For a good chunk of my life, up until my mid-late 20s, I drifted through life. I've had some hard spots. I struggle with substance abuse (previously opiates/heroin, now alcohol). However, I always seemed to have a smidge of positive outlook underneath, even when I was living on the street and addicted, and my friends were dying of overdoses left and right. Now that I've actively tried to better my life and plan for the future, I feel like everything is going wrong, and I have no hope for the future.

Every morning when I wake up, I wonder if today will be the day that I finally decide to end it. I feel so ridiculously alone. I know that a gunshot to the head would be quick and easy. I have lost touch with many friends over the years, minus a few. The few that I talk to, I would not burden with my mental problems. I have been to the psychiatrist and the doctor countless times. I have not found medication that helps me. I have tried Celexa, Lexapro, Buspirone, Effexor, as well as herbal supplements like 5HTP. At best, they do nothing. At worst, I feel like a drugged out zombie whose brain works at 25% (this is usually the case). I stopped Effexor because I could not focus at work and would continuously forget what I was doing, remembering nothing about what I did that day once the day was done.

I feel like there's nothing left for me to do here, except the final thing. I had 6 months sober from alcohol and pissed it away when I was feeling exceptionally down on Christmas. Now I'm back to struggling with that, despite the fact that I already have fatty liver. I feel that before, I at least cared enough to not want to die of liver failure. Now, I don't really give a shit. I also feel like my paranoia is getting worse. I constantly feel like most people are out to take advantage of others, but I'm not sure if that's just the depression that makes me think that way. Either way, I hate it.

I guess I'm just rambling now, but that's where I'm at. I would be grateful for anyone's help or insight. I am going to try to hang in here for tonight at least.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/runpvy/just_need_someone_to_hear_me_out/,runpvy,1. Seeking help and support

but every time. every single time i post my writing everywhere, a new wave of impostor syndrome drowns me.

i'm a fraud. i'm afraid, no, *terrified* that every time they'll find out. everyone will find out that i'm not ask good as they for some reason think and i'm actually a failure. i'm afraid that i'll be exposed as the shitty writer i am when someone really looks at my writing.

but it never stops there. when i'm already down the voices take control. 

the voices tell me i'm horrible at everything i do and i should just give up.

the voices tell me no one has ever loved me and no one ever will love me because i'm pathetic and would never be able to live up to anyone's standards.

the voices tell me any time anyone ever says something positive it's just pity, it's just being polite, and really in their head they're thinking about how fucking disgusting and talentless and obnoxious i really am.

the voices tell me that no matter how hard i try i will never be a good person and i will never find anyone who would even like me.

the voices tell me i should hurt myself because i deserve it and i'm just a stupid, horrid little bitch. the voices tell me to kill myself and that no one will miss me when i'm gone.

i can't escape from them. they come back stronger and stronger every single time. i can't share anything without fucking triggering them to come out.

maybe i should just listen. they're probably telling the truth. because really, even if they're lying, they make me want to roll up into a ball of self defense, and i'll probably drive anyone who cared away regardless.

u/Former_Eye7016,"Feel like a charity case, another friend left me and I self destruct my own friendships before they even start. I want to die is an understatement. I was afraid they'd hurt me snd they hurt me. I feel like a charity case, I got semi attached to someone after talking to them for 2 days and opening up to them, but thats fine and all but its just the things I say...I know they're self destructive and the cause of it which Is why I feel a fundamental feeling of shame. They said they get bored of people and find some people dull and stop talking to them...What do I do there? I immediately got scared and impulsively blocked and unblocked. I'm just not a good person, and I'm terrible at maintaining these friendships. I never have close relationships if I do they get ruined so I just feel like dying. I doubt the person will ever think of me again. im overwhelming and too much for people, and then I feel like the same thing will happen to all my other friendships. Its either I get insanely attached or I never spare a thought on you. Why is there no inbetween? I hate this I hate this I want to die its like the deepest darkest pit and void like i can get along so wel with people and i even make them laugh and smile a lot but im too much emotionally for them and I can understand when 2 peoples problems dont match one has to dip and they are negative for each other. For instance this person just got overwhelmed by me even though thats fine and normal it just makes me feel shameful and reminds me of my childhood relationship with my mother just overwhelming her and my dad never cared im just worthless literally so worthless i want to die i wish i could die or this could end, and this makes me so suicidal ahhhhh whatever though right?

u/Throwaway_x2539,"Can’t heal post break-up, so going to call it quits 30M here. My GF of 4 years and the woman I thought I was going to grow old with left me unexpectedly in May 2021 because I was emotionally abusive. I’ve reached out for both counseling and antidepressants, but they haven’t done much. She has moved on and has a long distance boyfriend now, while I can’t stop thinking about her every day, missing the tiniest of things like her laugh or touch of her fingers. It hasn’t gotten any easier with time, and I don’t see it getting better.

I think that now’s a good a time as any to end it. I’ll track down some alcohol and sleeping pills within the next 48h and go out looking at old photos of us, and will leave lots of food out for our cats, so that when she inevitably comes by to move more of her stuff to her new apartment, she’ll find them and take care of them.

Also, is keeping a journal a good way to vent out my emotions? i got one on christmas and I wanna use it but I feel guilt for venting or creating vent art, is there also some kind of safespace I could find?

I said I would make her proud, but I've failed multiple college semesters, my house is a mess, I have no friends, I got addicted to percocet at 17-18, and I don't feel like living in this world anymore. All I do is worry about money and college constantly. I have covid and I'm stuck in quarantine with my fiance who desperately needs mental help. I'm not religious at all, but I want to get my hands on any drugs that will kill me. I have my dad and some people I care about. But they don't know how fucked up I really am and I never want them to find out. Everything in my life that seems to come so easy to others have been challenges for me and I don't feel that I belong here. The only reason I don't do anything is because of my 3 cats (ridiculous, I know) but I know they can't take care of themselves. But lately it feels like I'm not even good enough for my pets.

u/Quiet_Chatter,"I don’t deserve to be loved by anyone. I hate myself and I don’t know why.  I have never felt deserving of anyone’s love.  I always push people away because I’m afraid to love them back out of fear they will hurt me or leave me.  When people try to love me, I feel paralyzed instead of comfort.  I struggle with severe mental illness and find myself in isolation a lot lately.  I do the best I can to tell everyone that I’m fine, because I don’t want them to worry or feel any of my pain.  It’s crazy how being depressed makes others depressed as well, and I don’t want anyone to be in pain like me.  I was abused and neglected my whole life until 17.  I can’t seem to trust anyone.  My depression is getting very hard lately and suicidal ideation is becoming daily thoughts.  I can’t tell anyone or ask for help because I’m afraid to be put into the hospital.  All I have left is my job and a home.  I have pushed all my friends and family away, because I don’t want to be a burden in their life.  I really don’t know why I am saying all this.  I just don’t have anyone I can talk to.  I just wish I wasn’t sad everyday and could live a somewhat decent life.  Trust people, love people, love myself, have a relationship, enjoy what little life I have left.  But I’m getting older and I don’t see much of a future for my life anymore.  I have to take medication for the rest of my life.  It makes me slow and my memory not very good.  I use to be a smart and capable person before bipolar disorder.  Now I’m just an empty shell of a person.  I only have memories of the person I once was.  I know my death would hurt people and it pains me to know this because I don’t want anyone to be hurt or sad.

u/Zealousideal-Bit-552,"It's okay..... right? I'm sorry for posting this.
First of all, i hope all of you have a good day. 

I'm 18 , a high schook students at his last semester in high school. I'm moved out from my former high school at second semester at 10th grade. Living alone, far from my parents, and only studied in school building for like...2/3 months, before Corona came and since then doing online school. And since then, i got no friends in my ""now"" school. ( I'm sorry for my bad English)

Okay, let this be short, i'm sorry for wasting the time of anyone that's watching this.
I'm a pathetic loser that doesnt deserve to Live...i think.

Before Corona, I can proudly say that i'm a good student, a good Karate-ka, and always trying to stay away from trouble. I can say that my family loves me, i have  good friends, and all of them put their hopes on me.

Since Corona, i can feel i lose my motivation and discipline, and i know i can't blame anyone but myself. I lost....i don't know my purpose of life anymore. Back then before Corona i can say proudfully, i want to become a Karate-ka, build a Dojo ( karate school) and teach peoples martial arts.
But since Corona i Don't even workout anymore. I lost my sensei ( karate teacher) , and i think he look down to me, from up there.
I can say back then that i wanna be a lawyer, but since Corona, i don't really studied anymore. I don't do any of the homework, doesnt even com to the online meeting, only lucky to somehow get a good enough Exam grade to stay at big Ten rank.
Back then i usually workout, and stay from perversion, but since Corona, i spend all day, doing ""that"" with my hand alone.

I know the realization come late, and at this point, i think i'm irredeemable. I betray a lot of peoples hope on me. I disgusted at myself. So....i think it's okay right? If i die, my family doesnt have to bear a son that's gonna be a failure in the future, if i die, they can spend more money and attention to my Lil brother. It Will do us good, right?

I say that, Bu truthfully, i'm scared of doing it. That's how much of a loser i am. Everytime i pick up the knife, i'm just scared. The idea of it gone from my mind. But i can't keep it. Everyday, the idea build up more. I hope i can die peacefully in sleep, but no. Every minutes, i think about it. 

Well that's it.
I hope you enjoy your day",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rus0o8/its_okay_right/,rus0o8,1. Seeking help and support

u/[deleted],"[M/20] Sick and tired of being single and a virgin I'm sick of being told things will get better because they never do and I've been here a million times, I've posted many of these before and nothing changes ever, I'm sick and tired of everyone else around me my age and younger (teenagers) having sex and getting into loads of relationships yet I cannot, Why do they think they deserve it more than me?

I know I may sound entitled. But the problem is my mindset. I have absolutely no self-esteem or confidence. And I'm sick of being in the minority, I feel this is like Insomnia where the longer you are awake the worse your anxiety gets except this being with relationships and virginity. And I refuse to hire a prostitute, Why? because I am not paying for sex when almost everyone else younger than me gets it for free. Why should I pay?

It has gotten bad enough that I have not eaten properly (although I am normal weight) I sleep only during the day and never at night, I sleep too long, I have no motivation to do things, I refuse to be friends with people who are in relationships or lost their virginity who are younger than me. And I have started to get panic attacks in public places.

I am seeing a psychologist but they aren't really helping me and I've been here before with the medicine, they do not work I have been on 4-5, the whole issue started with bullying for being single and being a virgin and reading online posts basically saying because I'm on the spectrum (and the fact that I have deemed myself ugly) I have absolutely no chance of ever finding ANYONE.

And please do not tell me ''Don't worry about other people'' My mind is not wired to accept this, I envy them and it is far easier said than done to tell me not to worry.

u/inspektorkemp,"Suicide is self-care. This is my decision. Many people who go to end their lives do so amidst thoughts of relentless self-hatred. Believing that they are horrid people who deserve to die for one reason or another, or that they will not be missed by anybody after their passing. 

I am not one of these people. I am aware of the people who care about me and the damage that my end would bring to them. I also do not hate myself. Not in the slightest. I actually think I'm pretty damn cool. I like how I look, I think I'm funny, and I'm a very kind and caring individual. I'm pretty charismatic and am skilled at a good number of things. Anyone who just looked at me would see a well-adjusted member of society, and by all accounts, they're right. 

I am also, however, in constant pain and suffering. Every day I awake, my thoughts are of my own death. Words like suicide, hanging, overdose, incisions, and so on echo in my head nonstop like a gruesome chant. Every time I close my eyes, I am haunted by the faces of those who have traumatized me and shown me cruelty for the crime of daring to try to exist, to be happy, to love and be loved, whatever it happens to be. I have experienced every form of betrayal and heartbreak. I have known the cruelty of a parent, the cruelty of romantic partners, the cruelty of friends, the cruelty of strangers, the cruelty of colleagues and supervisors, and the cruelty of my own mind. And I am exhausted. My body is battered and my back is broken. My soul lay gutted, and my heart stomped to bloody pieces. My eyes feel like balls of cotton in my skull. My head feels hollow and empty, like I could hear my brain rattling about inside if I shook hard enough, and my stomach has an iron ball inside at all times. My chest is tightened and burning. Some days whilst out walking I nearly collapse on the spot, for my feet have not the will to carry me any further, and simply give out from underneath me for the weight of the pain I bear.

And I know there is no escape from any of this. I have given life every opportunity to improve, and doggedly pursued the things I believed would make my life better. And I have done well for myself. But the trick about depression is that you can do everything right. Eat healthy, exercise, socialize, keep contact with loved ones, stay busy in a career that matters to you, pursue your hobbies, give yourself ample rest and recuperation after times of great business, go to therapy, get medicated, and seek all the help and support you can dream of - and still end up on a hospital bed after trying to end it all.

I have had enough. I feel naught but rage towards those jailkeeps masquerading as friends and loved ones who insist I must stay, despite the obvious fact that my pain will never abate. I am tired. I am *tired.* Tired beyond words in any human language can describe. Do not deny me this. This is my decision. I've a right to decide to cash out and quit while I'm ahead. I've seen what life has to offer. A world of cruelty, inhumanity, betrayal. A life of bullshit jobs, resumes, interviews, fake people, exploitation, rat races, and endless loss. I have lost so much over the past few years. I have put in great effort to bounce back - and I have nothing to show for it. Some might say that I still stand here is something enough. I vehemently rebuke this. That I still live is testament to my prolonged torture. A past life of mine must have done heinous things for my current life to be defined by such endless pain.

My suicide will be a mercy-killing, and the best, most decisive action to finally end my inhumane suffering in a world I never asked to be brought into. Being birthed was a violation of my consent, and I've every right to exercise in deciding to leave. I can no longer bring myself to care about those my passing will hurt. 

Sometimes people we love must do what they must for themselves and their best interest, regardless of who it harms. This is my decision. Among the few free choices I've left to me, and I will make it. Perhaps not now, or tomorrow. But it will be soon.

I will tie as many loose ends with others as possible while preparing for my grand finale. When I go, I'll bid everyone a very fond farewell - but one of the utmost necessity. I want to go home, and home is where I will go.
