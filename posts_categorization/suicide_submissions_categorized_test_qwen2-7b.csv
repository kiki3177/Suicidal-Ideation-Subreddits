u/attentionseeker1,"Time to summon courage/cowardice? Hello Reddit, 

I have been very depressed from the last couple of months. The main reason seems to be loneliness and lack of objectivity in life. I seem to have lost interest in everything that I was once passionate about. I am trying hard to find things that are worth staying alive but I am unsuccessful so far. I keep getting the feeling that everyone hates me. I am not a particularly bad person(except if I am on a reality show), but I seem to be disliked by many. I keep getting haunted by the fact that I have no friends. I am an introvert by design but always envy the extroverts. Some people close to me dismiss my claims as baloney and say that I am doing all this to get attention. They claim that I am a upto-no-good attention seeker who is pulling off this drama in order to get sympathy. I am convinced it is not true. I don't like the spotlight and big groups and crowds have always been a put off for me. 
I always liked to think that a strong emotionally secure person doesn't need any friends, but right now I am just unable to apply it to my life. Moreover, I am in a distant land right now continents away from my family who have no idea that I have such designs in place. 
I just cant stay any longer and am trying to summon enough courage to take the fatal step.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nyxsk/time_to_summon_couragecowardice/,nyxsk,1
u/Eurynomus,"Suicidal girlfriend. Need advice Hi there, and thanks for clicking on my post. I'll try to make this as short as possible. First of all, I am not suicidal and I do not need any help. It is my girlfriend who has recently been very suicidal and is in need of the help. She doesn't go on reddit or anything so I figured I'd post here to get some advice for her.
 




We live in different cities, approximately 6 hours apart, and sometimes due to outside factors I am unable to drive over and visit her. Anyways, she has been increasingly moody and depressed for the past few weeks. (She has always been, but never as much as now.) Basically, she says some things that contribute to her misery are her loneliness, as well as recent arguments with me. I ask her to expand on those issues so that I may offer her advice or look for a solution, but she refuses to talk and just threatens to kill herself. Sometimes she says she even does it just to have my attention, which she has ALL the time, anyways. Obviously this worries me a lot since I cannot be there with her at this time, so I do my best to care for her from a distance.





Last night she tried to OD on I have no idea what kind of meds. I did my best to talk some sense into her but she just ignored me. She woke up and threw up, feeling really sick, however now she says it is not so bad anymore. Even now I am talking to her about it, and I keep urging her to see a doctor and a therapist, but she declines all form of help I offer her, with no reasoning or explanation; just a simple ""no."" When I keep talking to her, she says I'm too insensitive to her problems... Which does not make sense to me at all because I am extremely stressed over this and worrying constantly, doing my best to help her. This is where I need your help, Reddit. I have no idea what I can do for her from such a distance. She won't listen to reason and instead constantly wallows in her own misery. She refuses any help or advice I offer her as well. What can I do? I figured I could contact her cousin who lives near her to maybe help out, but I was thinking I'd save that for a bit later, probably after I get some advice over here. (My girlfriend is alright for the time being.)





I love her very much, Reddit. I want to help her so bad, but I need some advice on how I can communicate to her some form of advice... Something she will consider and understand. Or anything I can do that would prove effective in helping her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nyxih/suicidal_girlfriend_need_advice/,nyxih,3.Giving advice
u/68newman,"I feel weird posting here I feel like I'm imposing somehow on your kindness posting here. I feel like the boy who cried wolf when I come here saying I want to end it, and then don't.

I had a great Christmas. My parents visited. I spent time with my separated wife and my son Chrstmas Eve, Day, and then New Year's Eve. I still love her so much and want things to work so badly. I'm working my ass off on changing my ways that led to where we are now. 30 seconds before midnight, my wife got up from the dining room table where we had been playing a game, and went over to my son on the couch to make sure she gave HIM a kiss and hug when the ball dropped. It hurt so damned much. This morning I burst out in tears because I can't stand being apart.

I'm still without a job too. Didn't really work as hard as I could have in December to look or to keep my skills sharp. Getting discouraged and tired. I have my son this week and he's off school, so I plan on spending time with him and having fun this week, then back to being serious next week.

But these thoughts of just wanting to get the fuck out of here come creeping back. I don't deal with life well. I keep bashing myself for my mistakes, and the constant reminder with my wife gone doesn't help. I may have fucked things up beyond repair, and I hate myself for that, for not recognizing a good thing when I had it. I didn't even date because I had such shitty low self esteem from being so fat. Then I meet a wonderful woman and my dreams came true, and then I fuck it all up. I'm just so tired of everything.

I can't get the lyrics ""Oh yeah, life goes on... Long after the thrill of living is gone"" out of my head.

u/alphabetSoup1138,"I can feel the depression coming on and might need some help to get through it Hello all,

I'm not usually a depressed person (usually very happy), however, I find that when school starts and I'm under stress, even if it just little things, I become really depressed to the point where I am cutting myself and scouting places to jump if things get too bad. For a year, I have had a lighter course-load (15 credits) than my first semester which was when I first became deeply troubled and started to feel trapped, scared, and angry. This upcoming semester, I'm taking more classes than ever, and many of them are rigorous courses then I've ever had before. As the beginning nears, I have begun to have bouts of extreme stress overcome me and am fearful that I may become extremely depressed again. If there is anybody who would be willing to give me some help to avoid some of this depression I would greatly appreciate it.

Other details: 20/m sophomore 4.0 GPA on scholarship which adds to stress. Forever alone. No friends at all. 

Thanks for any help.

u/[deleted],"Tried to hang myself today and failed. This is my first ever Reddit post. I made an account here finally so I could seek... help? Perspective?

TLDR: After moving out of state with the one I truly believed I'd spend the rest of my life with, he grew distant and broke up with me and now I've spent a month fixated on my own suicide, which today culminated in me trying to hang myself.



The whole story:
I met B about a year and a half ago. Truthfully, we found each other on a fetish dating site, but we were shocked that we lived about two miles from each other, had both just gotten accepted into college in the same city (out of state), liked the same music/movies, and got along pretty well. We talked online on and off for a few months, then finally met in person and we seemed to really hit it off.
After getting very close, we decided when we both moved to school out of state, we would live together, as it would save us both money and we really believed we were perfect.
The first week we lived together was the best week of my life. We painted our entire new house together, decorated everything, put all of our stuff away, and shared a big comfortable bed in a very cozy room that we had made together. We couldn't stop hugging and kissing each other and telling each other how much we loved one another. It was perfect.
However, B was never very forthcoming emotionally, and every week, for about four days a week, he would drive two and a half hours home and stay with his mom. Without a job and school not in session yet, I was left home alone for half the week with nothing to do and nobody to talk to. After nearly two solid months of B spending more time with his mom out of state than with me in our new home, I began to become very frustrated and rejected, so I confronted him.
""I don't like talking about my feelings, but I'll tell you. I've been very depressed and this is my way with dealing with things. I need to be alone. Don't take offense.""
Once school started, B stopped spending so much time out of state, but now was consumed by a full time job and school - between the two he had 60 hours a week out of the house. When he came home, he was never very happy to see me, rarely talked to me, didn't want to have sex with me or hug me or kiss me. I began to feel extremely unwanted. He told me it had nothing to do with me and he was just ""busy and tired.""
I started crying myself to sleep at night because this person I loved so dearly seemingly wanted to have nothing to do with me. Although I'd been on antidepressants for some time, they weren't helping, and I went to therapy. That wasn't helping either. My family just kept telling me ""Things will get better."" It was a hollow and pointless gesture.



Then, the bomb dropped. B and I both went and spent Thanksgiving with our families, B was away from me for about three days. When we both got back to the house, I asked him for a hug and told him how much I missed him. He gave me a limp, loveless hug and said ""You're crazy."" I was stunned. I gave him a second chance. I said, ""Did you miss me?"" He backed away. ""I don't miss anybody,"" he said. ""Especially not after two days. It is just how I am.""
This person I believed to be so perfect and incredible, who once helped me feel so safe and confident, told me he didn't miss me when we were apart. I was destroyed.
We went to bed, him not saying a word for the rest of the night, not saying ""Goodnight"" and kissing me like he always used to. I began crying hysterically. He flipped the light on and sat up in bed.
""I can't do this anymore. I'm done. Starting tomorrow, you're finding another sleeping arrangement and we're through.""
I was in disbelief. I truly believed it wasn't real. I went to work and came home and tried to talk to him. I apologized for the night before. I thought this fight might blow over.
""No. I'm serious. I made you a bed in the other bedroom. It is over.""
It finally sunk in. We were done. I cried so hard I couldn't breathe. I wanted to die.
This was about six weeks ago. Ever since then, I've spent every day trying to believe that I'm better off without him but I can't. I love him with all of my heart. I'd do anything for him. I'd fucking take a bullet for him. But he doesn't give a shit about me.
He hospitalized me two or three weeks ago because I told him very explicitly about my plans for suicide and showed him how I had been using a box cutter to cut apart my leg.. The doctors didn't do shit, they gave me a prescription for sleeping pills (because instead of sleep or eat anymore, I just stay awake and cry) and sent me home.



Last night, B told me that he hates his life here and that he wants to move away. It became clear that there would soon be a time that B wouldn't be in my life in any capacity, even as a roommate. I freaked out.
The first thing I did was chug as much vodka as I could. I wrote a 10 page suicide note. I made a test noose with a bedsheet, getting used to the feeling and the logistics of hanging myself.
Today, I tried to hang myself with an extension cord. I failed. I couldn't get the knot right and it came undone. The cord was too long or something. I've thought about overdosing but it takes so much of any pain reliever to make sure it kills you, and liver failure is a long and painful process.
So, I'm stuck in purgatory. Suicide is too difficult and painful but life is too difficult and painful. I'm stuck. Therapy and meds aren't helping. My family and friends aren't helping. I just can't take this horrible loss I have suffered. The safest and most positive I have ever felt was with him and I can't deal with life knowing that it is over. I can't.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nypvq/tried_to_hang_myself_today_and_failed/,nypvq,1

u/throwawayagainandaa,"More of the same...suicidal...depression I am in my early 20s and I really wish I could just go into my garage and turn the car on. I feel like such a drain on my family. I still live at home because I can't find a job. I tried to go to college a couple years ago, but I ended up failing out and just don't feel like wasting more money and time because I'm beginning to see I'm not smart enough to go to college for anything useful (the classes weren't hard but I just couldn't keep up). As much as I've looked for any shitty job I can get, I know the pay will be horrible, and I'm unlikely to get out of poverty. The thing is, I've seen how my parents are forced to live. They work way more than full time just to get by. They hate their jobs and it seems like the only thing they live for is go to to work. If that's what's in my future, I don't even want to be here for it. Another thing: I've always wanted to be a mother, but I refuse to bring a child into a situation where they're just as unlikely as I am to have a fulfilling life. I sort of resent my parents for having me when they knew they had no money. Don't get me wrong, I am very thankful they're worked like they have to provide enough for me to eat at least, but I see how overworked they are and they never have any time for family life. I don't want that life. I want children so badly, but I'd never be able to afford to give them a good life. As I said, I'm having such a hard time even getting a crappy minimum wage job, and I feel so guilty because I'm an adult and my parents still have to support me. Hell, even if I got a job at McDonalds, I wouldn't even earn enough for rent.

I do plan on killing myself someday, but my family has already lost so many loved family members, I can't do it to them, even though they'd really be better off if I never existed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nyljs/more_of_the_samesuicidaldepression/,nyljs,1.

u/[deleted],"Maybe its just the drunk me, but I just don't feel like living Tonight was something I never wish to repeat ever again. I have seen something things tonight I want to never see again. I have never been a guy to feel much of anything, let alone express them. Alcohol seems to bring out the depression, but at least its something that's why I only drink once and a while.

Tonight I opened my house to my friends who were too drunk to go home or drive, I made sure everyone had either a bed, a couch, or a guaranteed ride home with a sober driver. Tonight made me realize just what the fuck am I doing with my life. The girl, which up until tonight I wanted to fuck so hard words can not describe; I've been texting her literally non-stop for the past couple of weeks told me she was coming to my house with condoms and planned on getting drunk....with me. Alright, sounds good, dream come true.

Tonight I got somewhat drunk, not too drunk. Tonight made me realize how terrible my friends are, this girl included. Tonight I walked in on one of my best friends gettin it on. Tonight I walked in on the girl of my dreams gettin it on. Tonight I saw one of my best friends and this girl on top of each other, something I will not I will not be able to remove from my head. Tonight, I'm making sure everyone is alive in my house. I'm changing sheets, pillows, blankets, anything else that has been thrown up on. Including both of them. Tonight made me recalculate my decisions, my goals, my dreams, everything. Tonight I literally have no place to sleep. None. My past out friends are occupying every corner of my house. What the fuck do I get out of this? A heartwarming thought that all of my friends are alive? Sure sounds good, but why don't I feel this? All I feel is depressed. Its more than what I've felt in the past. Much more, I can actually feel it.

So now I'm sitting here in a house full of past out bodies, puke and blankets/sheets that need to be changed. Why do I even do this shit? Why do I put up with it? This life is only bringing sadness and heartbreak. Why the fuck am I still living? Whats the point? I just don't wanna deal with this shit anymore. What am I getting out of it?

u/[deleted],"People keep dropping out of my life because they can't deal with my mental illness... In 2011 I was diagnosed as Bi-Polar. It explained so much about the last few years of my life, and events in my life in general, but it seems that now people just can't deal with me when my meds are unbalanced and I either become too manic or too depressed. I've lost several friends and a girlfriend because of this. I'm down to just my family, one close friend, and a handful of friends who moved away for college and I see so little of that I can't even consider them full friends anymore. I know I'm blessed to at least have that, but I still feel so alone all the time, and so scared that I'll just keep driving people away because of this disease.

I have suicidal thoughts, I don't think I'm going to do it right now, because I know from the last 3 times I've attempted suicide it hurts my family so much and just drives my friends farther away from me. But I still have the thoughts consistently, especially when I'm at work. I don't really know what I want. It's not exactly that I want to die. I just don't want to exist.

u/RentDueOnTheFirst,"Questions/Issues with therapy Maybe this is just my misunderstanding, but I've got a question about actually going and trying to get help.

From what I've been able to find out, therapists are obligated to report and commit you involuntarily if you have either motivation, a plan, or a time that you've formed to commit suicide, in order to protect you. I'd really like to get some help, and talking to someone I think would do me a lot of good. But honesty and laying everything out there seems to be the key to therapy, and if I do that, they'll lock me up. (I don't have a time set, or motivation, but I do know how I would do it to make it look just like a car accident.) 

If I were committed, it appears you have to stay for 72 hours, and that would cause me to not only miss work and school, but entirely drop off the grid for family and friends. And while I've kept any sign of this tightly hidden, everything would be out in the open. In addition to probably getting fired for missing work, that kind of stigma with your name never goes away. And as much as people try to be understanding, that uneasyness would always be there. That kind of thing actually would push me over the edge.

I guess it just feels kind of hopeless to know that I'm trying to beat this, and the ""best"" option for help would probably cause me to actually do it. Sorry for all this, I just wanted to get it out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nygtj/questionsissues_with_therapy/,nygtj,1
u/throw-away4444,"Writing a letter to my future self, it sounds a lot like a suicide note. Not sure if this counts, since I don't feel like I *want* to die, but…

At the end of every year, I like to write myself a letter about how the year went, how I'm feeling, and what I learned... kinda like a journal for the whole year at once. Everything about it seems to show how the year started off not very good and got progressively worse. Losing relationships, losing jobs, losing pets, losing insurance; the overall collapse of my my life into a singularity of failure and misery. A lot of the time I'm telling myself how I wish I could've made things work out, but I failed. Maybe if I was smarter/richer/better-looking things would be different. I made the most with what I had, but sometimes that's just not enough.

I don't consider myself suicidal, but the more I write and the more it seems to be an underlying theme that my life has been full of disappointment and woe, and I really wish I didn't have to do it anymore.

u/theendthrowaway,"I'm 16. Dealing with social anxiety and depression my entire life. It's amazing I've made it this far, but it's time to say goodbye I don't know why I'm posting this, I don't really expect anyone to read it or care.

I was a fat kid through elementary school. I don't know why I ate so much, I guess I was just raised that way. My parents should have taught me appropriate portions. I had severe social anxiety all the way back in kindergarten, I don't know what would cause it. I had trouble talking to my kindergarten teacher or any of the other kids. An example of how bad it was is that I started crying when a kid asked me something about the watch I was wearing. I always was made fun of for being fat. I had no friends, and physical activity was rare for me. 
I was raised to sit in a room on the computer for long periods of time, playing games and watching movies. I would play the computer and video games way into the night, until my eyes were so heavy I could barely keep them open. Video games were my life because it was so hard to interact with people. My grades were good in kindergarten, I'm not stupid or anything but starting 4th grade my grades began to drop.  In 5th grade one of the people in my class moved in next door to me. It was a girl and she had a brother and a sister. We all started being friends kind of, but my step dad would hardly ever let me go over there even though it was just across the street and their mom was always there. So I just continued not being social and playing video games all day every day. Later we moved away, and I never saw those neighbors again. In 9th grade I moved to a new state and didn't know anyone. I couldn't talk to anyone, my face would freeze up and I couldn't think. My grades dropped because even if I did homework I would be too shy to walk in front of the class to turn it in. I ended up failing that year. I got into computer programming for a while, but my computer kept getting taken away and the internet was unplugged all the time and I wasn't allowed to use it. I failed at programming. Now, I've lost about 40 pounds. Success! But I'm still a little fat and have no friends. I'm failing a lot of classes this year too. I got upset about girls all the time. I failed at girls.
I applied for a job at mcdonald's and couldn't even get that. My clothes are shitty because I'm poor and never get any clothing, and if I do it was because it was cheap and on sale.
So I guess I failed at having friends, having girls, having an education, being physically fit, looking nice, having a hobby I'm good at. I never keep in touch with my family. It's the same thing for me every single day, going to school and not talking to anyone, then coming home and isolating myself. I think I want to leave this world now, because it's too much.

I'm 25 and feel a strong dislike (or quite possibly hatred) towards most other people (mostly caused from working a retail job and seeing how people truly are), overweight and just in general have very low self-esteem.

I can't stand the fact that I'm depressed over random stupid crap either, with how weak I really am that I can't surmount this.

u/Crystal_Munnin,"My mother is a survivor of attempted suicide, my uncle committed suicide in June and then my cousin a month later. Ask me anything. I would like to extend my heart to anyone who feels at their end.  Even if you feel like the whole world is against you, and that no one is going to notice when you are gone...  They will.  I am writing this to give you someone to talk to that has been left behind by someone that thought we would be better off without him.
My uncle Joey (my mother's brother) was a pretty terrible person most of the time.  I don't have many happy memories of him growing up and as an adult I stopped talking to him for years.  However, for all the awfulness and chaos he created, he had such a brilliant mind and when he wasn't in a destructive mode, he was incredibly loving.  With an IQ well above 140, he could have moved mountains.  My Mother, Uncle and I would spend hours discusing creativity, poltics, science, ideas and theories.  No topic was safe.  
But Joey was very manic, experimented with every drug known to man, and several that probably are not; though nothing was worse than when he drank.  I hated him with every fiber of my being when he would get in these phases when all he could do was detroy.  And it was always a gamble of when it would be.  Several months of boundless energy, hope and happiness, then crash and burn.  A few times my mother ended up institutionalised because of his episodes.
New Year's day 2007 my cousin and her huband found my mother dying from a Tylenol overdose. The house that I had grown up in was being forclosed on because my mom was caught up in one of his many dreams that failed and stopped paying the morgage. She needed to escape.  (Mom herself has a story too, battleing depression, alcoholism... Ask me what it is like for your mother to tell you that you are a selfish and horrible person for wanting her to stay alive when all she wants to do is die.) Mom thankfully recovered after three days in ICU and is a much better person. I do not know what I would have done without my Mother.
It was after that I refused to speak to Joey for nearly four years until I was forced into seeing him when my grandmother was moving.
We rebuilt our crumbled relationship, because even after all the horror that was my uncle, I knew he loved me and, for as much as I wanted him to go away, I loved him more than I ever got to tell him. 
There was always reservations in the year and a half that followed our reunion.  I wouldn't tell him where I lived, and I always feared the next time he would lose his mind.  
That day came when he stole my Mom's car, admitted that he had been lying to her the whole time he lived with her about having jobs, not drinking and trying to improve his life.  My mom lost her mind when he disappeared and was once again admitted to the hospital.  A week went by with no word from him...
The day Mom was due out of the hosipital, I was working the morning shift at my Hotel.  Taking down breakfast, I was casually watching the local news.  Suddenly, they showed a car just like my mom's, only a different color.  ""Man in his 30's found dead in car at local park.""  I nearly dropped the orange juice.
I immediatly texted my aunt. ""Has anyone heard from Joey yet?""  Creeping dred and horror filled me... I paced and tried not to worry.  It wasn't him...  That's not mom's car...  No.  No.  No...  I walked into my bosses office literally about to tell her, ""I think my uncle is dead.""  Just as I walked into the office, my cell phone rang.  It was my Aunt.  
She tried so hard to mask her trembling voice, casually asking me what I was doing, and so on... She asked me to come over after work, the family needed to talk.  I nearly screamed, ""Joey's dead!  Joey's dead isn't he?"" 
She started to cry, saying family shouldn't find out over the phone, it shouldn't happen like this...  I said the news told me first...
Luckily my boss was there, because I was on the floor screaming.  She closed the door, and held me until I stopped.  When I could breathe again my Aunt said that my Mom was not out of the hospital yet, and my Aunt wanted me there when she picked her up.  So, my boss called my boyfriend to come pick me up and we left immediatly since I live an hour from the rest of my family.
Unfortunatly the man in the car was not Joey.  He was dead for 5 days before a jogger found him in a state park...  I really can't go more into that because some of my family doesn't know all the details and I can't take the chance of them finding this.  They were found the same day though, and I know it was the Creator, Spirit, God/dess whomever... Someone wanted to prepare me... And for that I was greatful, I needed it for the horrifying days ahead.

I was in total shock.  Joey was immortal.  He survived mutilple overdoses, beatings and drunken maddness...  Shovels to the head... He was not dead.  No way.  But he had taken his own life.  Joey had hurt everyone he ever cared about, but none of us wanted this.  My mother (and their two sisters but my mother worst of all) and grandmother and been ripped to shreds physically and mentally by this man for nearly 39 years and they will never recover from his death.  
I still have nightmares from when we told Mom what happened.  Her screams are something that will haunt me forever.  Grandma nearly had a heart attack, we really didn't think she would live through the day.  
When my cousin found out aboiut Joey, whom he grown up with and was very close to, atttempted suicide and failed.  The day of Joey's funeral they were fighting to keep my cousin alive.  Unfortunatly, when everyone thought he had recovered, and everything was fine, he also took his life.  I had not seen Kevin in nearly 13 years, and though I am very saddened by another tragic loss to our family, it has not haunted me the same as Joey.  But my Mom, aunts, grandma (Kevin's Aunt) and Papa and great uncle all must suffer this double loss.
I guess the real point of all this is; if you think no one is going to care that you are gone, you are very wrong.  Hope died with him... I had a great epiphany the other day while studying once of our favorite subjects, I thought man I can't wait to get to mom's to tell uncle joey about this.  The world fell out from underneath me when I suddenly recalled that my uncle is now nothing more than a pile of ash sitting on mom's shelf.  I can't ask him anything anymore.  There is no hope that one day he actually could be the great man we knew he was.  I hope that my loss can help someone who thinks they have no alternative, talk to me, ask me questions, and you'll see exactly what you are going to do to the people you will leave behind that love you.  Much love to you all.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o0czx/my_mother_is_a_survivor_of_attempted_suicide_my/,o0czx,3
u/[deleted],"I want to go to sleep, and never wake up again I hate my life. I'm a slave to everyone around me, nothing but a ragdoll, someone to make fun of, bitch at, push around like I'm nothing. Everybody does it, and I'm ready to just give up everything. My parents only use me as a slave (~4 hours of household chores per day), EVERYBODY at my school clearly hates me (teachers, students, even the guidance councillors) because of they way they treat me. I'm more intelligent than most, and because of that I get treated like dirt. Tons of extra schoolwork, bullying, you name it. I cant keep up with any of it. People at work don't like, me (I work at a tim hortons) and the customers are all assholes to me. On the outside I alway try to be a happy, cheery person, but its getting harder as the days go by.

Right now, I am locked in my second story room, with a 3 story drop onto solid concrete that looks extremely welcoming right now. I have almost 30 allergy-relief pills that look quite delicious right now. I have a coffee maker with scolding hot water, 4 espresso pods, and 40 or so coffee pods, and I could easily drink that all in the next half hour, just to try to stop the pain. I can't go on like this.

I do, however have one friend I know I can talk to, but really don't feel comfortable talking to because of previous experiences with other people and my state of mind. The first girl was a good person, my best and closest friend, the first person I could ever talk to and trust. When I first started feeling this way, all I wanted to do was talk about it, and try to work things out, and hopefully she'd make me feel better. All she did was overreact, bitch at me, and told me to fuck off forever. Apparently I was ""pressuring her"" and ""making her feel guilty that shes the one who did this"" when I told her all the same things as above. The person I'm currently really close to, and old childhood friend of mine (we recently just started talking after about 8 or so years) is extremely supportive, and has been through this herself, so she knows what its like, but I'm too scared to even bring it up, because I feel like shes going to bitch at me and leave me alone forever too.

I should mention at this point I've never been in a relationship, and always feel really lonely, like there's nobody out there for me. The current girl is a friend, and we'll probably stay that way forever. I've never had enough guts or courage to talk to a girl unless they talk to me, for fear of ridicule and bullying.

Sorry for this massive read, I'm just feeling really low right now, and I just want everything to end. I want to go to bed right now, with no worries, and never wake up again. I'm done with this life, I cant stand it.

u/donnie0darko0,"can't handle daily life... copied and added to from r/depression I usually eat one (very unhealthy) meal a day, haven't taken the trash out or done dishes or laundry in Weeks, I wait until my dog whines to take him for a walk and he chases his tail because I don't play with him.

I've missed a lot of payments lately even though I'm pretty sure I have the money. I got a phone I didn't need to upgrade to and a car I'm pretty sure I can't afford.

I keep making the same mistakes over and over, a large one being spending money stupidly (is that a real word?). Sometimes I don't even check my account until i've overdrafted. I have this irrational fear that consumes me and feeds into itself.

I also have IBS which may not seem like much but paired with depression means almost every single thing i eat upsets my stomach in some form. I've basically given up and just eat crap that's easy and tastes good (junk food, fast food).

I think I could benefit from inpatient counseling, but the thing is I have a job that requires a security clearance, as well as being in the air force (national guard). I don't think either would appreciate my having depression. however, now I actually have insurance from my job, so it would make sense to go now.

I'm not going to do anything right now, but I have clearer and clearer plans in my head (razor to wrists, noose in closet, ...). I will see my counselor tomorrow, and I'm considering not going to work, I don't have the energy to do much more than sleep lately.

I also have the chance to deploy with the Air Guard, but I don't think there's any way I could bring wellbutrin along without getting busted, and being unmedicated with access to a weapon is probably not going to be a good idea the more I think about it.

I am very lucky to have my job, which pays very well compared to what it actually is, and it requires a security clearance. It's easy- help desk, but it's also incredibly stressful to me, I hate talking on the phone and that is all I do. It seems stupid to hate a job that pays so well and is so menial, it's not like I'm making minimum wage in a retail store or backbreaking labor for low pay; which makes me feel even worse.

I could ask my parents about borrowing money left by my grandparents after they passed away, but I've been telling them I'm doing fine with my finances and life, I don't want to have to go back. But I am miserable.

Thanks for reading, i'm not sure what to do.

I'm 20 years old. I know I have a lot in life. I have a few great friends that I love to spend time with. My parents love and care for me and think about my future. I used to be book smart, quick-witted and funny. But I don't feel natural or myself anymore. I used to be the funny guy - goofy, silly, and joke around, and used to enjoy it. I used to just lightly poke fun at people. I don't want to be that guy anymore. I want to provide meaning to people. I look at my best friends and see that they have it better than me - natural personalities and when they talk they mean it. For me, I talk for the purpose of maintaining conversation. Besides my few best friends - who are all social and I think successful - I have never maintained a strong relationship with anyone else. I've never had a girlfriend, and have only been close to a few girls. I feel as if I have nothing to offer to people. I don't feel as if I have my own true opinion. All of the things I say are a collection of what my friends and family feel. In group conversations I just add random remarks - sometimes funny - to try and get a response. I don't feel that I am a genuine person... and that is all that I want to be.

u/meowmeowzzz,"I feel like this is logical. I feel like I have reasonable reasons for wanting to die. My quality of life has almost completely diminished. Two years ago I “cheated” on my boyfriend ( I got drunk and made out with a gay guy). My boyfriend went psycho. We lived together at the time. My days were spent either being called a whore, being pushed around, or kicked out on the street until he decided to let me back in. Unfortunately for me it only got worse. Turned into beatings/strangling not long after that, he ended up giving me a concussion on valentines day. So I’ve pretty much given up on life (I'm still with him). I've said fuck it to showering or getting out of bed in general. However I go to school and work but then back to the fetal position in bed. BUT ANYWAYS, my point is, that im pretty fucked up now. What I wrote is just skimming the surface of the shit i've endured in my life so far. Its safe to say that I will need a SIGNIFIGANT amount of therapy to be able to function physically, socially, etc( which I cant afford). Plus, since the abuse started i've have some social anxiety problems. I break out into a rash when ANYONE talks to me. Sometimes a shake or even twitch. This is amplified when talking with men.

u/[deleted],"Just have to vent, and this seems like a nice place... Sorry for the broken english...
So yeah my girlfriend dumped me 3 months ago... we've been together for 6years and half... went through what normal couples go through, good, bad, ugly and beautiful... I've been a dick and it's all my fault... I've made a promise to myself when we started... I would never let any girl break my heart ever again... For 5 years...5 fucking years I didn't care, I loved her and I still do, I just kept a certain distance... but for the last year and a half, it's been pretty clear to me, even for her, that we would have kids together, grow old together... We even spoke about it the day before she left me... For the past year and a half, I tried, I tried so fucking hard to be what she wanted me to be...She felt it was fake, but it wasn't... She has been so fucking nice to me the first five years that I wanted to show her, but I'm good at screwing things up. She went back to university, so we moved to her parent's place, I went back to finish high school (yeah I know...) And I'm starting university soon, but i'll do it from home (I don't know what's the name for it in english, i'm too lazy to google). So yeah fastforward 3 months ago... She called me late in the afternoon, told me we had to talk... I knew it, I enjoyed every seconds every single breath before she arrived, I knew a shitstorm was comming, I just didn't know it was going to be this big... Basically, we didn't had a lot of things in common, but what we had, was ours... She realised i would never change enough to be what she wanted me to be, felt bad about asking me all these things... Just the usual breakup bullshit. So I took a couple of things, my backpack and left the house. I walked for like an hour or so, found a phone and called an old friend of mine to pick me up. I stayed at her appartement for like 2 weeks, long story short I had to work close to her place and I didn't had a car... So as soon as I got there I called my dad... ( I'm 26 and I found him when I was around 18, he didn't know he had a child) I explained him what happened, I asked him if I could come to his place, since I had nowhere to go. He said yes... He fucking said yes... I bursted into tears. Fastforward to now. So i've been there for 2 months and a half, he lives like an hour away from the city, nice and cozy house in the country. I'm working 2 jobs friday, saturday and sunday nights, for a total of 30hours, and tuesday ,wednesday and thursday during the day for a total of 24 hours. I guess being overworked saved my life, but i'm tired, i'm not thinking about her really, but I keep having these fucking dreams where she's there, dumping me all over again. I just can't take it anymore. She made alot of new friends in school but for me, all of my friends became her friends during the years, I haven't really made any new friends. So now they have to share time between us... Holidays fucking sucked... But I only kept like 2 close friends all those years, they are now good friends with her... I've been trying to make friends since she left me, but I find it hard to relate to people, I'm having a hard time finding people's qualities and I keep seing things that pisses me off. So I basically had 4 people on a christmas party I made at my place, 2 of them didn't really wanted to be there and left like an hour after they arrived. I even had a crush on a girl for the past month, turns out she's a mess. It didn't work out.
* I'm a burden for my father
* I have no close friends that I can share how bad I feel
* I work all the time so I have no time to meet new people (and when I know I can't stand them)
* Every moment alone feel like my head is going to explode
*Seriously thinking about getting the car in the garage, taking sleeping pills, wait for them to kick in, start the car and sleep peacefully.

I know that by doing so I would make my family, or what's left of it, sad. But It's either them or me, that would be a selfish move, but they would get over it, I lost the reason I lived for. I won't change anything  in this world, or at least not something significant. I'm too tired to start everything over with someone new, you were the one and still is...just fucking come back...j'taime caliss

I want to be with them in heaven with Christ. I have no descendants. I have no connections with my siblings. What would be any different if I were dead anyways. Being dead is just the same as moving away. People are sad at the departure and then every one moves on and you are forgotten anyways. What is wrong with being forgotten whether dead or alive. I'm just rambling. I have survived three other suicide attempts in my life. Death is scared of me, so I ain't dying tonite. I am just rambling and crying. Wondering why. 


tl;dr -- Single, middle-age, orphan, w/ no meaningful deep connections. Why should one continue living.

u/throwaway1235811321,"I feel like I've gone down the path of my life for 
which success is not the correct choice. People used to respect me, I think. I didn't think they did because I was still always so self-conscious. I thought many of them hated me. I thought I hated me. I have wanted, on-and-off, to kill myself since the age of 12. I am 18 now.

I have been smoking a lot of a certain synthetic cannabinoid over the past few months because getting high helps distract me from myself. I hate that I'm even writing this, I shouldn't be. I'm not one of the people that really need help. Ever since I was 8, I have absolutely abhorred the idea of seeing psychologists. I'm not insane. I'm not clinically depressed. I have no need of professional help.

I've been walking a lot at night lately and in November I walked to a nearby park with a lot of trails. One of these trails goes by a lake where geese like to gather during the month or so before they migrate. They seemed like Greeks in Plato's academy, discussing important and academic goose matters. I walked to this park, and when I got there I was drenched and every piece of my clothing was soaking because it was raining quite heavily. I planned to wade into this lake and slit my wrists with the knife I brought. But upon approaching the gate to the park, I stopped for several moments, before ultimately deciding to turn back and head home. I decided to do this because I didn't want to be eaten by bears, and I wasn't sure if bears make their rounds in those woods.

I've always heavily associated colours with everything, especially music and people. My friends say they do not relate to this when I explain it to them but I know it is a normal thing. They just don't realize it happens to them.

But once I started smoking, the colours became more important, and they became accompanied by other senses. I have been glimpsing childhood and all the important symbols that dominated life in my earlier ages. I have been quite literally travelling back in time, but I can't change anything. There are no paradoxes to worry about, because the universe is neither deterministic nor random. I cannot change what I do at age eight because who I am at age eight remains the same. When I wander about the yard of the house I lived in when I was young, short as I was when I lived there, I wonder if the waking world of me with eighteen years isn't some distant dream.

There are too many coincidences and too much magic in the mundane for the story I have lived to be governed by anything less than an author's pen. I have often fancied myself to be that author, but I have many colours, and I am not always the author. I have always held a strange suspicion that I cannot actually die, and any attempt to end my life will result merely in a life of misery in a wheelchair. But I have recently gotten the suspicion that I have not actually lived the past ten or even fifteen years at all, and that if some screaming automobile were to steal my life, I would awaken with a start in my three-year-old body, free to begin again.

But I don't want to begin again. I want to take all those chances I missed. I want to correct my mistakes, which are worse than those of most because they were committed by so vile and so empty a human being. I want to return to the time when the Girl Who Is Blue loved me, and when I loved her, and I want to make something of that. I want to go once again through the mediocrity of public schooling to the end of success, as a mind of my calibre truly deserves. I want to undo all the misery and petty fights I had with my stepsiblings. I want to not be so afraid of everything. I want to have lived.

But I have not lived, and when I have tried, I have revealed myself to be a shell of a human being: not as intelligent as everyone around me had always said. Not as moral as I liked to believe. Not as charismatic as the colour Red had me painted when I was young. I have memories I scarcely can call mine, because my body has been home to a series of small and feeble cowards, each less genuine than the last.

I have not lived, and all I have to show for my unlife is a long list of unappreciable ramblings in the form of poetry and prose. Certainly I will be missed when I decide to depart, and at this point I must. The successful me branched off much earlier in my life, and while there exist paths yet which lead to prosperity for me, they are not the correct ones for the place I am going. I cannot expect to be respected when I cannot respect or even like myself. In some crystal clear moment of perfect sobriety I will lose my fear of fate and remove myself from this world. Not tonight, I think, because there is still a will to live somewhere in my chest. It is faint, and it is tired, but it is there.

I just wish I could apologize and make a difference. I just wish I could stop and turn around. I wish I was never so good at running away. And when I really think about it, I want to die not because life is painful or unbearable in the slightest, but because I am.

u/stopthistrain,"why is a worthless life worth living? help me redefine worth? Hello.
I am a 25 (soon to be 26) year old female. I am have 2 or 3 more semesters to go before finishing my bachelor's degree. I have been suffering with some sort of generalized anxiety disorder or depression since youth. This is one of the reasons I don't want to have children. (I don't wish to pass on these flawed genes to future generations). The other (main) reason is that there is so much evil in the world. I do see, and acknowledge the good.. but the evil is there, and it is AWFUL. seeing others around me hurt brings me unquantifiable pain. i have countless acquaintances and they will all say nice things about me: she's pretty, she's funny, she's so kind, she's selfless, she's brilliant. and not to sound cocky, but there is truth in all those things. i have always been very intelligent and with such intelligence i developed great wit. I'm physically attractive and have been with attractive partners. I have felt for years that if I by some crazy science defying moment had the opportunity, I would make it so I was never born. I try not to think about impossible things, but it is a sad recurring one. I just don't feel like I have any truly quantifiable value. Scientifically, as an animal it is my duty to reproduce.. but since that isn't going to happen, do I really have business being alive?

I admit that I touch a great deal of lives on a small scale with my random acts of kindness.. but it isn't enough for me. The universe is, after all, homogenous and isotropic. It used to be enough.. that was how I got through the day.. by making someone elses day a little better. 

Because this whole ""wishing i was never born"" thing is ridiculous.. I decided several years ago, that I would just try to enjoy my time on Earth as much as possible since there really wasn't a way out. 

I don't have a good relationship with my family. The ex boyfriend that was a great part of my life for several years is involved with another and unable to communicate with me. 

I'm ready to check out. I'm not sure how, or when. But why should I stay?

EDIT: at this point I'm only more convinced that I have no business prolonging my life. 

EDIT 2: I'm sleepy. Still no reason to stay alive. Step up your game, Reddit.

u/1throwawayawaythrow1,"Struggle to convince myself that ""life isn't a race""--please help There are a lot of things that get me depressed &amp; suicidal, but what makes me want to quit is largely based on the idea that life *is* a race. I don't believe in an after life, so the absolute, finite nature of life makes it hard not to think of it as a race. Time is limited, and you will never again be able to experience youth and the whole process of ""growing up"" (say, your first ~25 years of life). So missed opportunities, missed experiences, and time lost due to dwelling in pain &amp; loss cannot be recovered. I feel this makes it possible to actually be a ""loser at life,"" and it starts to make more sense to ""quit the race"" than to ""finish it."" I feel those that usually say that life *isn't* a race are just those that are leading in the pack and having a good time, so they don't know what it's like to ""fall behind"" and have this sense of loss.

I recognize this is unhealthy thinking, and I can see that thinking the opposite would be helpful for recovery (I think it might be the missing link this whole time as friends &amp; professional treatment have failed). I just can't convince myself to let go of my painful past. I recognize it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, too. If I keep this up, I will just continue to be miserable, and will waste more of my life, which will just depress me even more...but for that alone isn't enough to convince me to not think of life as a race.

u/[deleted],"Downer than ever, just needed to vent. This new year is getting to me. I'm no more important than any other fellow-being with emotional problems and writing here for help and advice seams some what wrong, like i don't deserve any help because this is my problem and my alone, for that same reason is hard for me to ask for help, so, i usually never do. 

Getting to the point, i feel miserable, i really really do and it pains me so much inside that i cant take it anymore and something gotta give but the last thing i want is more suicide thoughts, they disturb reality and prevent me from self healing, having those thoughts in my head never helps but sometimes i can't stop them, i guess i am just weak minded.

What is the problem and why? Getting old, watching my dreams getting behind and feeling like they will never come, thus feeling like i truly am a failure. Desperately alone with no one to talk, i'm a 26 year old guy with almost no real friends and the ones i do have i grew tired of them, mostly because everything is always about them and i just feel so tired of sacrificing myself for others and never getting the same treatment. My last relationship ended almost 3years ago and since then my self-esteem been decreasing steadily and it's almost depleted at this moment.

On the 31th i put all that behind me and went out with some relatives. Well, it backfired, everything came flashing back once again, seeing all the nice people partying, the beautiful girls, i realty felt like ""forever alone"", all the memes that i usual i'm so keen to laugh at were coming into reality, my reality.

It's hard for me to meet new people, even online if i see someone that i think interesting i just ignore thinking they will not have the slightest interest in me and that i would just be a bother to them. In person is even worst, there is always a panic attack waiting to append and even if it doesn't the fear that it might is always present, making me hopeless and thoughtless, resulting in a very uninteresting person.

The past? Well, broken home, parents divorce, mother issues, the usual.

Working, i don't have the strength nor the motivation anymore.

I know everything is solvable, especially emotional problems, that tomorrow anything can change, but at this point i feel that knowledge and feelings are just enemies trying to kill each other, and in my case the feelings are winning. &lt;Need Hug&gt;

I hate my self for hating myself. Being smart sucks, thinking is the worst and doubting is just painful. Crying helps for a moment, the feeling of total hopelessness tends to vanish for a moment, but its like a cat, as long as you feed him it will always come back.

After all this, what i feel i need, is someone that understands, comforts and assures me that everything will be alright. This is all i ask and been hopping for, but in the end (at least until now) i have been giving the short stick, everyone just seams so far away from me. In a fairytale point of view i would only ask for a ""prince"", but this is reality were nothing is effortlessly nor a kiss in the frog saves the day. 

Other thing that makes it all the more ""stupid"" (for me), is that i actually have a pretty face and a normal composition, and although this last few years been putting on some extra ""depression"" weight i still hold some charm, or at least that is what i want to believe. But that is not enough, i lack the strength to overcome my fears and talk to people resulting in me feeling hideous and unattractive, that i have nothing to give and thous nothing deserve. 

At this point in writing this post i feel like it's all a mess, gibberish if you may, but i will try my best to leave it unedited since i need someone to feel my unbalanced mind, everything seams coated with feelings in a clothed mess.

SuicideWatch might not be the best place for me since i battle with this thoughts and they usually stay at bay, but i just don't know anymore, the tiredness is giving in to the thought. It's not like me, i'm becoming something else my foundations are collapsing one by one to this point.

English is not my mother thong so i ask of you to forgive any spelling or grammatical mistakes, feeling like i am now makes it hard for me to process every thought in other languages and translate them into words i don't often use.

u/Fool2012,"Im a broken human being So last night was the best/worst night of my life in a long time and right now I am so low and helpless and confused. A girl that Ive had a long history of mine told me she loved me last night while we were holding each other in bed at like 3am. The way she said, the way she was holding me, the way she was kissing me...
I havent been able to have sex since my first girlfriend when i was 18 after we had broken up after 3 years. She told me she was gay and it was a really hard thing on me emotionally. And i guess i have never recovered. I feel unlovable and not worth if someone is willing to give me their love. 
This girl last night and i have tried to have sex before but it just wont happen and again last night, it happened again, granted we had been drinking all night, but i had so much riding on this happening, getting over this hump, starting the new year in a great way. But instead it was a nightmare, i left and went on a walk and was really just thinking i should go jump off a cliff that was nearby or you know just end it, im useless, im broken.
Somehow she talks me back to the house and she brings me to bed and this is when she tells me she loves me. Im so fucked up in the head im not talking im just going abck in forth in my head thinking shes fucking with me, how can someone after what just happen, AGAIN, could she be saying that. But, like i said, the way she said it, over and over and the way she was holding me, kissing me...i believed her. We have a good morning just laying in bed and doing the same stuff. Kissing and holding each other, literally the most happy ive been in 5 years( 23 now).
Fast forward to this evening, im been wrestling my mind all night, trying to figure out what she exactly meant, and texted you know, if she meant what she said or if it was just a way to keep me from doing something stupid. She said she had told me she loved me before and it hadnt changed and thats when i figured it out, and how fucking stupid i felt, i told her its one thing to love someone and another to be in love with someone, and i was in love with her. And she said she didnt know thats how i felt and yadada and when i wrote her back she never responded.
So now for the past 4 hours, ive been cutting myself, punching walls doors, freaking out, crying, thinking of one fucking reason to live, other than my family, and cannot come with one fucking reason. I want to die, i dont want to have to feel alone like this for the rest of my life, im scared of what i might do, cause i dont want to hurt the people id leave behind but I just do not know if i have the strength to go on feeling like fool and loser i am.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nzaur/im_a_broken_human_being/,nzaur,1
u/BeefyStevey,"Not really suicidal, but I know suicide is the correct answer. I'm 22-years-old, I live with my parents, I've never had a job, I left college after three years because I failed the same class five times and still couldn't figure out a major, I then went to community college and failed all my classes (including that class I failed five times) because my mind kept telling me that I'm a complete failure, and I don't have a car.... okay, that last one's a little silly, but it still bothers me.

I'm almost 23, actually. I have accrued a fair amount of debt from college, so that also sucks. I can't ever see myself getting a job as I'm a lazy fuck-up who can't leave the house -- I mean, I'd love to leave the house, but I don't know. I just end up stuck on the computer all day. There's also not much to go to around here. Sorry, going off-track, I feel like a piece of shit because my parents haven't kicked me out onto the street yet. I'm sure that if I lived on the street, I wouldn't want to kill myself. Sure my life would be shitty, but at least the only person who would be suffering would be myself. 

That's another reason I want to kill myself: I'm sure that me being alive is a constant disappointment to my parents, so at least if I kill myself now, they can get over it. I'm sure that I'd come up in their minds in the future (""First son killed himself, yeah, sad.""), but it'd be little blips here or there, where as now it's (like I said) constant disappointment.

With all that said, why shouldn't I kill myself? I mean, I don't want to be dead as life has some cool things, but if my parents have to suffer because I'm alive, well, that makes me feel awful. And I don't want to change either. Like I said, suicide makes the most sense.

EDIT: Also, this is my first time on SuicideWatch and I have to say that I dislike the Reddit bots all smiling. I feel like I'd feel more at ease if they were all depressed. Though, I guess that's more for /r/depression (though there they still have a smiling robot).

u/alovelydream,"I want to see the ocean When I was 4 years old my mother a man named Tom. Tom was rich. They knew each other for less than a year before they got married. I'll never be sure why she married him. She says she loves him but I don't believe her. Anyone can say that. But do they really mean it? Maybe she married him because my dad cheated on her when I was one and she wanted to get over him? Who knows. But anyways at 4 I knew that she shouldn't marry this man. She never asked me. I know I was four but I knew that they shouldn't get married. He was weird. Something too fake about him. At the wedding me and my cousins and soon to be step brother and sisters tried to stop the wedding or at least came up with a plan. I thought that if we each kept leaving to go to the restroom that they would stop and wait for us to return but we wouldn't and we would stay in there all night so they couldn't get married. I left in the middle of the ceremony but 20 mins after I was in there one of my moms cousins came in to get me because the ceremony was over. They were married. I was horrified. How could she get married without me there? Oh well I guess. So maybe a few months after they get married he starts to get really mean (no he never physically abused me) but just words were torture. He would tell me he hated me and my mom hated me and she wanted to give me up for adoption and he would throw pens at me to shut me up and when I used to suck my thumb he came in my room and made me sleep with my arms stretched to the side of the bed and in the middle of the night if I moved my hands he would come in there and yank my hands back to the side of the bed. I remember the first time he told me he wanted to kill me and bury me where no one would find me. I think I was like 6 or 7. But after that I hated life. He told me I was worthless. A waste of space. I remember I tried to kill myself by stabbing myself with a a knife (haha) but they all freaked out and grabbed me so I couldn't hurt myself. I wrote notes to my mom that I wanted to die. I told her everything that he said but she never believed me. I remember trying to run away but someone always found me. This was all under the age of 8. After that I gave up. I just dealt with it (I still do). I still tried to prove it to my mom but he always got me when I wasn't prepared. My mom told me he loved me and sometimes he acted like it. Sometimes we got along. Sometimes I believed that he loved me but then he would turn around and tell me that I should die and no one wants me. When I was nine he was starting to build a house for us out in the country and he would make me and my step siblings go out there with him when we had nothing to do. But if we ever did anything wrong like made one us cry we had to sit in time out. My siblings got to sit in nice places of the house like our rooms that were being built but he would lock me in one of the closets in the dark (I hated the dark more than anything) for hours until he was done and I would cry myself to sleep in there. After the house was built and his kids moved in with his ex the verbal abuse continued but now I try to avoid it. I try to avoid him as much as possible. In my early teens I was the brattiest, meanest, little girl. I was terrible I would yell and scream. I was the worst to my mom ( which I hate myself for) and one day when I was being a little bitch my worst fears were confirmed she told me she wished she had given me up. I was stunned. I wanted to die. After that I tried to be better. I made friends who I spent most of my time with. I tried to forget about my past. I still live at home so it's hard. I used to want a bunch of attention from my friends and I would tell my really good friend/boyfriend at the time that I was gonna kill myself but I had too many friends but if I didn't have them I would do it. It was also for attention when I used to tell him that. But I was still half serious. I went to a therapist a few years ago (I am 20 now) but she just said that he loved me and he wanted the best for me that's why he is so mean. But I think she is fucking crazy so I left and never saw her again. I don't trust anyone. They let stupid ass people be therapists. So lately I feel confused. I think I really needed to get that out I'm sure I'm being a little baby. I realize that people have to deal with worse stuff everyday. I have nothing though. I mean I have a boyfriend who I love more than anything and he is the only person that I trust but I just don't like to talk about this with anyone. I'm pretty sure I haven't told anyone that whole story like I just did. But I have nothing. I'm not passionate about anything. I like to play video games and travel. But I don't have a job or money because I'm lazy (working on that right now). I feel like a waste. I don't deserve anything but I know I'm so fucking lucky it's ridiculous. I don't know if I want to kill myself but I feel like I don't deserve to live. So I think I should die. I think I just needed to get that out.

u/[deleted],"I'm putting together a suicide prevention pack for my New Year's resolution... Hey people! Trying to go through with a halfway resolution... It's more of a promise to a friend, and to myself. I'm trying to beat my struggle with self-injury &amp; wanting to die, to put it bluntly, so I'm putting together a little bag of ""alternatives"" that I'm taking with me everywhere. I don't have a whole lot... only some cigarettes so far, and the design for a cheap tattoo that I'm planning on getting (getting a tattoo vs cutting... it makes sense to me).

u/OneYear,"I'm going to give myself one year I guess I'll start off by saying that I feel guilty just typing this... I've read through lots of the posts on here and it just makes me feel pathetic, but I guess we all have different tolerance levels.

I first had suicidal thoughts around the age of 13, I was bullied, got into a lot of fights and my parents got divorced; and they've come and gone ever since. 

These past three months have been the worst, though. I'm twenty years old, I've been unemployed for a year and a half, I don't have a single friend, hell, the only person I see on a regular basis is my mother, and that's only because I live with her. On top of that, it's looking like I might have Crohn's disease.

And I don't really see it getting much better, I don't really have any skills so I don't see the job issue being resolved any time soon; I've had four interviews in the past six months or so and I'm applying for hundreds.

On the friend front, well I don't get out much. I used to enjoy my solitude especially back when I was still in high school, but these days I find myself just staring into nothingness wondering whether what comes next will be a relief, wondering whether there is anything else, whether or not I'll get another chance.

The only relief I ever feel is when I'm running, playing video games or reading; and even these have been losing their effectiveness. 

So; I've decided I'm going to give myself one year. I'm going to try. Not really sure how I'm going to proceed, but I am going to try and improve.

I've got to admit, typing that out was rather therapeutic.

He's a nice guy and she seems happier than I can ever remember her being.  I think this is where my problem arises, the fact that I'm such a terrible person that I can see she's happy and all I can think about is my own happiness.  I want her to be with me not because I think it will make her happier, but because it will make me happier.  I disgust myself, and the fact that I'm having these thoughts about ending everything disgusts me as well.  I have no one to talk to, she's my best friend and whenever I had a problem before she's who I could and would talk to.  I don't have many other friends and none close enough where I can talk to them or feel it's right to bother them with my problems.  In fact as I write this I feel sorry for you because I am burdening you with my problems.  I am so alone right now, it's dark and I'm afraid of what is going to happen.  The only reason I haven't done anything is because I know it will make her feel bad.  I can tell she know's something is wrong and she has asked me, but I can't tell her.  If I tell her it will only make things worse.  I wish I could stop feeling the way I do it would make things so much easier.  I'm ashamed of the way I feel and the fact I have to ask other's for help.  I am always the strong one, the guy who can get through anything, always the happy one ready to have a good time.

u/captainregularr,"Fiance and I split, and I am depressed. Let's talk! We were together for 2.5 years, and at the time of when I broke up with her I was 24 she was 22.

We went to the same school together, had an unbelievably mature relationship, extremely loving and sweet, agreed on how to handle nearly everything, etc. Everyone thought we would get married, and I believed it.

After the first year of being together, we went long distance every three weeks seeing each other (and it was fine!). Towards the end of the long distance, just after graduating, I noticed her personality was getting funky. She was freaking out over small things, emotionally became strange (ex: on a family vacation we paid for her to come on, she had an eye infection. A family member asked how her eye was, and then she got very upset at me because of that), and at the end was slightly rude. Still, we had a great time and the sex was great.

We moved in together, she started stressing over graduate school, not having a job, getting into a school, and then becoming broke. I did my damn best to support her financially, but she refused to get a ""normal"" job to support herself in the meantime until a more ideal one came along. She would have breakdowns all the time. She became selfish - I asked her to come to places, but she wouldn't unless it was somewhere she wanted to. She was very cuddly with me, but the sex pretty much stopped - she said she was good once every three weeks. 

Anytime we got into an argument, she would run home and never discuss the issue. She became super jealous for no reason. I did make mistakes, but I would admit fault and work them out patiently, calmly, and asking her how she felt. But, if I disagreed with her, she would not care about my perspective. She never held herself to her own standards (ex: no cursing, but yet she would curse at me and didn't care when I called her out on that calmly, though she would later apologize afterward).  She also compartamentalized everything, and cared about how she would be looked upon (ex: she likes feeling independent, but didn't want to tell anyone we were living together because one of her girlfriends gave her crap for that idea). Times where we planned on doing things she would change (ex: we bought tickets for homecoming weekend, then she says she just wants to go with her girls because it's the first time they're all going together - complete 180 of plans a few days before the game).

Even when going the distance anytime I asked her to join me to a buddy's party because I wanted her to be close with my friends as well (like I was to hers) she wouldn't using the classic line she likes, ""I don't have to if I don't want to."" Even if I would say ""Have a good time tonight"" She would say ""Don't tell me what to do, I will have fun regardless.""

What makes this all worse is that despite her tendency to run away from problems, refusal to see my POV, and all of her habits, I read (unintentionally) in her diary how she still desires her ex (very strongly) from four years ago who cheated on her. She admits to texting him behind my back, but none of this is an issue in her eyes (if I did the same I would have my throat slit, and originally she would have told me this type of stuff). I pushed to talk about it, and she kept trying to delay the talk, and then I gave her an ultimatum and ended it. She claims, in a later talk, that her diary was a way to get ""stupid thoughts"" off her head - but the most recent entry I read was WAY TOO STRONG to be a ""silly thought"" and nothing about me was written. Note, this guy has been overseas for over a year, so they did not cheat, period.

**What kills me** is that this is a total 180 from how she was before we moved in. It was during a point of high stress in her life, but no stress is 24/7. I would try to work our problems out maturely and calmly and she refused to. She would claim all sorts of things, too. For example, on vacation she gave me her word about a certain topic, and after all the money I spent on vacation she went against her word. When trying to talk about it a few times she simply used the frustrating ""I don't have to if I don't want to"", and I really got upset and quietly cursed (not at her, eg ""Fuck you"") and told her she was being ridiculous and unfair. She cried, said I was abusing her publically. Another time, she went to hit our dog because the dog bit her a bit, and she was about to whale on him so I held her wrist back - she claimed abuse, again. Another thing - at the end, post-breakup talk, she said that she ""wants to make decisions in relationships by her book"" (which reflects her mother-father dynamic, she runs ship). I told her nobody would ever support this in a relationship, not me not somebody else, and she said ""don't tell me what to do"".

After all of this, I tried giving her sympathy texts, offering to work stuff out, to forgive and discuss, to love as we once did, but she refuses to. She never told anyone the reason(s) we broke up, simply saying she wants to ""Focus on herself."" She asked me not to say anything to anyone. 

I cannot help but wonder, what happened? Why did all of this occur? Why was it a 180 from who she was? I want to work it out, but she (like with most things) doesn't want to, and placed huge blame on me - I never once heard what she was doing wrong at the end, even though I was admitting it on the phone where I could be better. Why throw over two years of 95% great memories out the window because she has too much pride, too awful problem solving skills, etc. to work things out?

Though, let it be known she was very sweet for the most part, cute, etc. but her attitude towards sex did a 180 after moving in (said ""we live together now, unlike first two years, so of course I'd want it less.""). Funny thing - her best girlfriend called me up asking how I was doing a week later, which was unexpected, and when I told her the absolute truth about everything she said my ex needed to do a lot of growing up because she was sheltered her whole life.

We did everything together, and I really believe that her life stresses and inability to work things out led to the downfall of our relationship. I want to let her know this, but anytime I've pointed things out she refuses to see it.

u/yeahspose,"X-post from r/self - Reddit, I found potential suicide letters in my mum's dresser and need words of wisdom or advice.
 I originally posted in r/self as I wasn't sure where the right place for this was, but someone suggested I post here for advice, so here goes.

I am 19 and live with my parents until next year. Throughout my life, my mum has stuggled with depression and suffered a massive breakdown when I was a child. She has been doing so well the last few years, and still has ""down"" periods, but her life is so much better and her depression is largely controlled by medication. However, today I discovered somethig very upsetting. I opened her drawer looking for something, and found a couple of letters. Now, a couple of years ago the same thing happened, and I found a letter adressed to my dad...I know I shouldn't have read it but I succumbed to that morbid curiosity. I snooped in something private, and regretted it, but I couldn't help myself. This letter was clearly intended for after my mum had died.

My mum is only 52, leads a very healthy life and has no underlying health issues, so it seems odd that she was writing this. After reading it I felt pretty shocked that perhaps suicide had crossed my mum's mind again after so many years, and this really threw me. I thought about it for days and felt so guilty but I never said anything about it and gradually forgot about it, rationalising it in a number of ways and putting it out of my mind.

So today, I wasn't thinking about anything like that when I went looking for a make-up item that I thought might be in this drawer. But, there they were. Letters to me and my grandma (I think there were more to my sister and dad but I didn't want to look further). Again, I peeked when I know it was private and I shouldn't have. But I kind of knew as soon as I saw them, and seeing one addressed to me I picked it up and began reading instinctively. This letter was dated September 2010, so this was written AFTER the one I found a couple of years ago, and was clearly intended to be after my mum had taken her own life as it said things like, 'I know you will feel angry, and hurt, but remember I will always love you'. This pushed me over the edge. It's so surreal to read something like that, intended for after her death. I can't even imagine what I would do without my mum. She is my best friend and we look after eachother mutually, possibly sometimes I take on the role of the mother more, but I take for granted how much I really need her around.

It upsets me so much to know that sometimes my mum is this unhappy, and actually thinking about her own death, and moreover preparing for it. This is the second time in the last few years I've found something like this and it kills me. OK, so she didn't actually do anything about it these couple of times but who's to say she won't feel like this again and something might really push her over the edge?

I know there were some factors, like her dad's decline due to dementia and eventual death in December last year, that could have been why she felt so low...but I'm so worried. She hides her depression so well, especially from me because she thinks I can't handle it and in a way I can't...what if this is on her mind more than I think it is? I know I shouldn't have looked, and that is the moral of this story I guess.

Reddit, thank you for reading this, it feels better just to get it off my chest. It would be great if anyone could offer words of wisdom, or share stories, or anything really.

Long story short, I broke up with my girlfriend of a year then realized that was not the right decision about a month later. When I try to contact her again, she has already been seeing someone else, and just thinking about that makes me go crazy.

u/Toastyparty,"Don't really want to be an attention whore, but I'm exhausted I really don't like where my life is heading. I have so much self loathing in me. Ever since I was very young I have been fed this bullshit that I'm smart, or that I'm going to be an amazing businessman. I studied entrepreneurship and the faculty even made a special mention in graduation that I was going to be in forbes by the age of 25. I completely believed all of it. Not to the point where I became a jerk or anything, but it did set the expectations pretty high. I quickly learned life isn't that easy. At least I'm smart enough to know that now. That's not what I'm ranting about. I never felt cheated I didn't accomplish these great thing others saw in my future. I'm just exhausted that there is no possible way that my life gets better emotionally. All I do is disappoint everyone, most of all myself. I don't think I would ever do it, because I fear death more than anything, but I think about suicide a lot. For some reason it soothes me to think that I might off myself someday. That some day I can close my eyes and when I open them I'm in a completely different world. I'm not social enough to make new friends, but I'm not anti-social enough to fit in a niche. I'm just me, and for some reason, it is never enough for anyone.

My dream is still to become a successful entrepreneur (though not as before that I wanted to be a philanthropist and save the world with money. Just so I feel fulfilled.)

Maybe I just want someone to listen, or maybe I just want someone to care. But most of all I just wanted someone else to know how I really felt, even if it's someone I don't know.

u/iamthrowingaway,"22M - I am trying to be strong. I don't want to hurt anyone. I am afraid I can't do either. I'm sorry this is a rant, but I want someone to hear it. When I think about suicidal thoughts, I trace myself back to middle school, when I would think about throwing myself in front of a car or a large bus -- if only to see what would happen. But these have always just been in theory. I have always come off to others as a cheerful guy with his head in the right place. People see me as reliable, stable, and a man with direction. I helped a friend of mine with her problems just last night, and she left me with the following: ""you know, literally every time you come up in conversation with anyone I know, it is never about something you've done. It's always, 'hey, [x] is just... a really good person.' I say that as a compliment.""

I am not any of those things. What people need are goals, whether that is a family, or a job, or a dream, or really, anything to keep as the light in the darkness that leads you down the path one step at a time. When therapists or whatever talk about ""hopelessness,"" it sounds like a load of shit -- it's not hopelessness. It's the lack of a goal, of direction -- it is the lack of that something that doesn't *make* us alive, but rather *keeps* alive, gives us something to live *for*, rather than live *through*. When I was younger, I was sure I had so many things figured out. Golden boy in school, captain of the soccer team, urged by teachers to go to music school, or to med school, or to become a lawyer.

I look at my friends in college planning out their lives now, planning for grad school to get a job, to make money, to get a family and have kids. Others are planning for a life in music (which, to be honest, has always been my dream), others in medicine, others in something else. At the end of the day, all I have appeared to others is as a ""good"" person -- but what does appearing ""good"" entail? I am neither moral, nor faithful, nor honest; but I tell white lies to people and take that burden upon myself to give a third party some solace -- my being a good person is but an appearance, just as being beautiful is as much of an appearance.

I am too far in my life to change these things. I have written an album, a *full* album (just sketches) complete with musical ideas and motifs, themes linked together, as though I am trying to piece together the different melodies in my life. No one I have shown it to is impressed - they are disturbed, unsettled, turned away from it and towards the shallow shit music we have today. And that is my problem -- that is my decaying dream -- that has taken that goal, that light in the darkness, and extinguished it. I am groping my way through the night, hoping for a rope, or the shimmer of a flame that I might warm myself by, but it's not there. It has been lost -- and with it, I am lost. I am a proud person, but I am twisted up in my own mental acrobatics, and not a soul can help me. Nietzsche talks about the pessimism of strength, that by realizing that life is meaningless, that our existence is transitory and over in a heartbeat of existence, we can gain strength from this realization, that this life is the only one we have to live and that we must live it to its fullest.

I am not an Übermensch, and my theories just seclude me, my pessimism festers in my head like a poison, and I want to say I am a strong enough person to defeat my demons, and I want to *be* that strong person. But in my moment of reason, I have to admit that I'm not. Reason only takes us so far -- reason can take words and bend them into such shapes and forms that we manage to justify the death of 6 million people as ""ethnic cleansing."" Reason can take words and justify that a man making a billion dollars should be taxed less than my dad.

I am at the boundaries of my own logic, and as I stare into the abyss, it stares right back at me. I stand face to face with the darkness with no light to lead me through it. Where my next step lands, whether it takes me slowly up the path out of the darkness or further into it, I am completely helpless to decide on my own.

u/my_fuckin_neck_hurts,"I just had a brief but vivid visualization of how easy it would be to leave this world and to never feel pain again   Regarding the title: I can walk for ten minutes and arrive at the apex of a bridge, and should I choose to jump from there it would definitely be fatal. I'd never again know the condescension of my parents or peers. I'd never again know the physical pain from the fucked up neck I've been battling (and drinking against) since last May. I'd never again have to behave as if everything was okay, as if I had a future in which I'd constantly be motivated to do well and to achieve and to succeed and to find happiness through pure attrition. If I went to the bridge and just jumped, I'd be freer, or so I think, than I presently am.

  It has come to my attention recently that I am not cut out for this world. I'm an evolutionary cul-de-sac. I have suffered precisely the wrong upbringing and environmental conditions to render me an arrogant, self-confident, resourceful and strong enough individual to make my way in this world. Humiliatingly, I had the world handed to me on a silver platter, and then I tripped over my own shoelace, spilt the platter, and never recovered from the shame of my failure. I tried to work as a manual labourer, with no obligations but to show up and to work for 8 hrs/day. If forty hours a week of painful exploitation is in fact the extent of human experience for someone of my character, then I'd rather not go through the painful charade of pretending to be enthusiastic and willing to work ad infinitum. I'd rather educate myself and be poor than earn an income and be miserable. So I've gone to school, and I find that I am not free to pursue my curiosity, but instead I have to subscribe to a narrowly focused programme consisting mostly of quantitative components for which I have neither the inclination nor the aptitude. I've got A's in literature, economics, and political science, but it isn't enough. Apparently university is about becoming worldly and universal and having a broader perspective on everything, including pointless quantitative crap that I'll never think about ever again in my life, and owing to my deficiencies therein I am barred from achieving my academic goals.

  I am unfortunate enough to be born in the wrong place at the wrong time. In the long run I really cannot see myself doing anything economically valuable, or contributing to society at all, because as the adage goes ""it's not what you know, but who you know,"" and I don't know anything or anyone. Seriously, what the fuck do I do? I'm cowardly. I'm anxious. I'm socially inept. I have a strong distaste for capitalism and everything associated therewith. I mean, I have to advertise myself and lie about my skills (which are nonexistent) and experience (which is pretty slim) in order to get into a entry-level position anywhere, in order to merely eke out an existence in our world? Why not just admit defeat, and kill myself, and hope to achieve more in death than I ever could in life? I really cannot see anyone missing me. As I alluded to earlier, my family cannot seem to accept that anything is wrong with me, they just tell me to ""go see a vocational guidance counsellor"" and to ""get over it and move on."" Very likely indeed. I seem to have deluded myself into thinking that ""friendship"" has meaning. Friendship, in my experience, means never having to call. It means never having to honour commitments, and never having to say you won't until after the fact. It means always having someone more important to hang out with. It means that even when you're hanging out together, you don't owe any respect, much less attention, to your friends. I have tried to take this all in stride. What should it matter, thought I, if my ""friends"" would rather not hang out with me, and lie to my face if they have to? If they consider that to be friendship, then shouldn't I lower my standards accordingly? But to no avail. Me being myself, I can't just go to someone else. I expect too much. I'm narcissistic and needy. Owing to some unfortunate circumstance in my upbringing, I feel like there is some basic standard of universal concern for other human beings that must be carried and extolled. I am too often embarrassed and proven wrong.

  I've no excuses either; as I mentioned earlier, I had the world handed to me on a plate. All I had to do was shut up, stare at my toes, and keep listening to my parents and walking forward, and I'd graduate, get a job, and live the dream. And I don't know how I could've fucked it up. Maybe I was too conscientious, and could never accept that I could just push myself and others into getting what I wanted, and then live comfortably at the expense of others. I don't know. But somewhere down the line I felt something was wrong, and that maybe there was more to life than just putting on a pair of blinders and drinking kool-aid. But even though I pushed myself down that path, I didn't have the energy to continue. I feel now that if someone could just give me a pointless bureaucratic job and a place to live I could just shut the fuck up and forget about everything else in the world, and just spend every hour off the clock getting high and jerking off. And then on the other hand I think that I have to challenge myself, and question everything, and fight against the status quo, but I soon realize that I lack the bottomless reservoirs of energy and motivation that everyone else doing the same has, and for being such a lazy hedonistic slob I deserve to die. By my own hand. As I said, I have a bridge less than ten minutes away.

  So that's how I feel right now. It's taken more than twenty minutes to type this up, and as I'm still here, I haven't yet killed myself, I assure you. I probably won't, either, as I'm a goddamn coward and a narcissistic attention whore, so please offer your platitudinous responses whilst I sleep. But if nothing else I feel like I have to state my case. As a TL;DR: I've tried all the likely routes to happiness and failed. If I have to be unhappy for the rest of my life, then my life will almost certainly be quite short.

u/throwawayranger,"I don't know if this will help anyone, but here's my story. Sorry for the upcoming wall of text, but here goes.  Also, sorry if I break any rules!

I've been suffering from depression for most of my life, as far back as I can really remember.  I suppose it took a turn for the worse when I lost my best friend in a car accident in my senior year of high school (~5 years ago), but it's been present throughout my life.  

My Dad was never really there for me;  although he wasn't abusive, he was and is an alcoholic and 2-pack-a-day cigarette smoker.  My Mom was there, but I never really noticed it.  Depression runs deep in my Dad's side of the family, and he's been suffering from it most of his life.  

I can remember my first suicidal inclinations and daydreams, starting around 8-9 years old.  Simple things about jumping off cliffs.  Those might not have been 'real', as in they might have been 'L'appel du vide'.  Regardless, real suicidal thoughts were there and I often thought about ending the pain and suffering, especially since my best friend died.  I even went abroad for a year, and came very close to it many times during that year.

The feelings I had were terrible.  I didn't want to wake up.  I didn't want to see anyone.  I wanted to sit in my locked, single occupancy dorm room and play video games for the distraction.  Eating in a dining hall with my friends was hell for a while--I couldn't look at them because I felt so... guilty, and worthless.

After thinking about it for years, I finally made an appointment to see a counselor at my college.  It was tough.  For a while it felt like I was giving up on myself, and that I was admitting that I wasn't good enough as me, as I was.  That first step was the first step forward.  

After attending a few counseling sessions, I made the effort to talk to the university doctor about anti depressants.  She gave me the information (anti depressants can worsen depression, other side effects, and what I'd have to do to make it work, etc.) and the choice, and I decided that since I'd already made it this far, I'd better keep going.  I felt I'd fail if I didn't.  

I dedicated myself to my recovery.  I wasn't supposed to drink, so I didn't.  I began working out regularly, and noticed improvements in my mood.  I won't say I'm perfect--I definitely have my bad days when I skip the gym and don't eat very healthily, but I haven't done any drugs or alcohol in 10 months.  It took some getting used to, but now it feels normal.

The anti depressants didn't fully kick in for almost 2 months.  They've been working great since then--I take them every day at the same time and I haven't missed a day yet (a few hours off here and there).  

My social life has improved exponentially.  I like going out to do things with my friends.  I have good, and sometimes great, conversations.  It's not perfect, but coming from where I've been, it's phenomenal.  

Life is worth living.  I had to break my determination to do it on my own (which wasn't working) and accept help.  But it was worth it.

I hope my story helps someone :)  Be back for any questions later.

u/BoogerfaceMcgee,"Has anyone else been here? How should I cope? Ever since I was a child I made a promise to myself that I would kill myself as soon as either my mom or dad died.  It was a weird promise to make, but for some reason it stuck with me to this day (am 25 y.o).  I made this promise to myself, because to me the passing of one of my parents marks the start of a new chapter in my life.. A chapter that entails me watching the rest of my family (6 kids &amp; 2 parents) growing old and wasting away - Something I don't think I can handle b/c I love them all so much.

I was always okay with not doing anything. To say it differently, it's always as if I don't want anything for dinner, I'm okay with steak, but I'm okay with no steak, I'm also okay with not eating dinner.

As a background, when I was young my mother was very strict with me and beat me a lot, sometimes for a whole day until I'm so numb I stop crying, bleeding all over.

~~... I got anally raped several times by my best friend's mother (also my mother's best friend).~~

My only escape from all this was a friend I had who would always entertain me with silly random things (like weird insects he found or pictures he drew etc). We both barely spoke so it was like a silent movie. He died when I was 13 to cancer. Parents divorced when I was 16.

I don't remember an instance where I wanted anything. I may have once had goals, or dreams, but I don't remember them. I've met my fiancee 2 and a half years ago, he is currently in boot camp. He makes it a point to tell me how much he loves me, that he will die inside if I kill myself. Although I have tried to kill myself already (with paracetamol, which obviously failed) despite his perseverance. I am living with my father and his new family, and I don't want to intrude any longer.

I laugh a lot when I talk to people, and everyone loves me and considers me a fun person, but I don't have close friends and I can't keep friends, because I'm not interested in one. When I socialize for a day (when I'm not cooped up in my room), I get incredibly tired and feel like laying down and doing nothing for about 3 days.

I feel the need to be nice to everyone (with an exception to assholes), and I don't want to kill myself before I find happiness that my fiancee promises (I know it sounds fishy, but I... don't care? just like how I feel for everything else). But still I always dream about laying down and never waking up. I have caused self harm before but I have stopped because it was tiring to hide and care for the wounds. I wonder if I'm just really lazy, but as I have successfully completed anything given to me to do (like projects, or cleaning my room etc), even though I don't care for it much, I doubt that's the case.

I was taken to a psych by my dad, who wanted to try it out due to his sister's recommendation (she has an autistic son), as he thinks it's a bit worrisome that I lock myself in my room for most of the time. He gave me meds and said I had major depression. One of the meds, specifically Abilify, worked, and for a brief period I felt as if I was alive and I could see colors in the world, but I was unable to sleep (more so than usual) because of it. Anti depressants cause me to go into manic periods where I feel as if I'm just in pain, and cry for hours. My dad has stopped taking me to the psych and my medication has all stopped. He is christian and his pastor said one time that depression is BS (it was longer but that was the gist of it) and he refuses to take me back there despite me asking for it (I don't ask for anything).

My fiancee is the only one that showed this much care for me in my life and I feel the need to reciprocate it.
