[deleted],1274,"30‚Äôs but never got to build a life Is there anyone else in their 30‚Äôs who have been mentally unwell their whole life and have no job, resume, partner, kids, money, essentially dropped out of society and dependent on others to even drive places? Bonus points if your interests are ‚Äòyoung‚Äô ie anime, gaming, clinging to things from your childhood like Harry Potter and 90‚Äôs cartoons?

I really struggle to accept myself. Anxiety and OCD robbed me of hitting any adult milestones and I fear nobody my age will ever relate to me and I‚Äôm so sick of therapists trying to be a cheerleader and telling me how much I have to offer when I objectively don‚Äôt have anything to offer, cannot function and don‚Äôt even feel my age",[deleted],246,"Yeah.  I just had a mental breakdown. At 31.  Didn't build an adult life , no job , no friends , no lover . There isn't anything medical wrong with me - I just failed in every aspect in life.I can't sleep anymore.  Sleeping pills  don't work.  Been 3 weeks without sleep. If only I could sleep maybe there is a chance.  Not feeling hungry , mood swings constantly. 

It would be nice to meet people like us.  These professionals don't know how we feel.  

I am Dublin if anyone willing to talk | This describes my life perfectly! 32m, no job, friends, can't drive, education (after high school), career, significant other, or family. I cling to playing Pokemon (lifelong fan), and older games from my youth in a desperate attempt to feel something, anything that will even give me the remotest sense of happiness. I've felt like a worthless piece of garbage for the past 17 years, when the depression began. | why would you believe that it's all an issue if your hobbies which you believe are a bit ""childish"" make you happy?

you're an adult and you like what the fuck you like. if others wanna work 24/7 to pay off insane morgages and car payments while their kids try to break every expensive piece of ""valuable"" that they signed their lives away for then good for them.

and if you like anime and gaming and got no kids to bother you? no partner who nags you as soon as they got an issue with something? 

I'd say you're one of the most peaceful people in that age group and you should feel good about it. | Once again: words that could have been plucked directly from my experience. Been in your situation, but for longer. | Why yes this is me | [deleted] | I'm 40 and could have written this. I lost many years to OCD and memory hoarding. Not to mention external problems like my dad dying right before my 30th birthday, car problems job problems financial problems mom problems (daughter getting sick etc ) and now all of the sudden I'm 40 w nothing to show for it bc I've been struggling financially and emotionally and basically just surviving my whole life

Ppl younger than me usually gen z often write me off or dismiss as an old or middle aged woman little do they know I'm really just a sad lost little girl trapped in a 40 yo body. The ageism done by social media and gen z only adds to my depression. Ppl seem oddly triggered that I'm not who they think I am. They expect a kareny suburban type lady and I'm a sad lost depressive person still mentally 22 and no better off financially if anything worse off bc my credit is destroyed and I have no parental unit 

I feel like I got old before I had my time under the sun and like my life ended before it began. I feel more lost and hopeless than ever before. I struggle with thinking my best days are behind me and my best days were mediocre at best. I never really had my time 

In my 30s I kept thinking some day I would have "",my time"" where everything would fall into place. In fact I had this weird feeling that age 37 would be ""my year"". Couldn't have been more wrong. That year was 2020 and we all know what happened that year. My life fell apart even more. 

The difference between 30s struggling me and me now still struggling age 40 is I had hope for the future then. Now I have none. I take comfort in knowing one day my life will be over. I won't ever take it myself since I'm a mom . I know that sounds terrible and I apologize if that's triggering to others

Op thank you for writing this. | I got my car when I was 32. I'm 33 now. However. I've got at least three more years until I will even come close to ""breaking even"" (if that makes sense). 

I don't cling to things from my childhood because I do everything in my power to forget it... but that doesn't help my situation. Many people our age that still love gaming, Harry Potter, etc... and I cannot connect with them. Because technically, I have no interests aside from not going back to the homeless shelter. I'm trapped in survival mode.

Not trying to make my situation sound better/worse than yours - neither of us got to build a life, so we're both french fucked.

If my insurance covered therapy, I'd still be going. But I've invested A LOT of money into it, tried different meds... and I'm still in the same boat as you. | Hi, it's me. I'm 29 but I think nothing will change during the next year. | I know OP deleted their account but I just want to say thank you for creating this post or I would not have known how many others also felt this way. I am in this exact situation, mid 30s, no job, never worked, highly dependent, no car, just pure human garbage. I am a complete burden to people's lives. I am honestly a waste of oxygen and space and truly wish to cease to exist. | [deleted] | I'm 33 year old virgin. Almost completley isolated for a decade. Idk what to do or what to think anymore. All that normie, good-life culture is in one ear out the other with me.

I should be more grateful for what i have (job, apartment). But it still hard not to go crazy under the circumstances. | Yes‚Ä¶I‚Äôm over it tbh. I‚Äôm not interested in doing any better I want a redo. | Man I‚Äôm 25 but I feel like I‚Äôm not fresh like u said I‚Äôm not who people want to be around I‚Äôm not a good role model damn | Nah, I can't relate.  Because I'm 49.  I live at my dad's house and drive my mom's truck when she lets me.  Today, I had an interview at a fast-food restaraunt and they said they might get back to me--maybe.  Actually, things in life were going pretty good--and then I went to prison for two years.  Not to complain.  Prison was WAY better than being out here.  I'd go back if I could.

No attempt to one-up anyone here, I promise.  Just want to assure you all, in case there were any doubts, life is truly crap, and then you die.  Quickly, if you're lucky. | [deleted] | Ahahah sorry | Literally what I was thinking | Magnesium gummies or skin oil before bed can help sleep. | I thought loss of interest was part of depression (anedonia) and meds were supposed to help with that?? | Man some of us have a difficult existence | Fuck dude I couldn‚Äôt | I hear what you were getting at, but living with severe ocd and anxiety, I can honestly say I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt peaceful haha. I‚Äôd rather be boring, nagged and functional üòÖ | Oooof I feel this so so hard. I always think about how young people would see me as old, but I too feel like a trapped lost little girl inside. I‚Äôve been terrified of growing older since I was 13, but nothing could have prepared me for how fast it goes and how much hope slips away each year that passes | Hang in there. Depression didn‚Äôt do this to me. Depression for me is a side effect of the crippling OCD, anxiety, physical health problems, malnutrition and childhood trauma. Your brain can change so so much between 15 and where I‚Äôm at | Good god I hope not for your sake üòÖ! Hang in there. I‚Äôve been in the mental health system for ages and nearly everyone else I met recovered and is living their life | Maybe use us old farts as motivation to put 10000% into recovery while you‚Äôre still young, because it can often get harder to fight as we get older | I don‚Äôt dislike therapists. I still see one. They‚Äôre really helpful for things like exposure therapy. I don‚Äôt like ones who combat your negative self talk with a rose coloured glasses view though, because objectively a regular 30+ yr old is not going to relate to someone who is mostly housebound, has very poor mental and physical health, is constantly at risk of hospitalisation due to malnutrition, has no job, has zero savings to go out and experience life with you etc | I don‚Äôt think suffering from crippling and severe ocd is ‚Äòcrying over spilled milk‚Äô but thanks for your input | Disability | Got sleeping pills 1st time and only worked for 4 hrs ( zopiclone ). Then after that it doesn't. It feels like I can't get my deep consciousness to sleep | Yeah I'll try that.  I tore my Achilles recently so I limited in my movements | I meant before.  Obviously there is something wrong with me now . | Yg? | Sameeee ‚ù§Ô∏è | Thanks for the insight! I‚Äôm currently working on myself in therapy and am going back to work. I‚Äôm also taking up the piano again too. | and that's completely fine.

whatever keeps you going man. just know that whenever you've got time to spare instead of being anxious grab a beer and sit in the sun with some music or whatever.

being a boring person isn't as bad as you might think it is. | it's not like from time to time I don't think about how things could've been but in hindsight even fully happy people feel dumb when they look back at their past.

it's pointless. | Yes it's so hard when society perceives you a certain way and project that image they've decided you are onto you, idk if that makes sense, but they have no idea what you are feeling on the inside. I think that only adds to the complex layers and deeply troubling feelings. All I can say is to those people is keep living, they will reach this age too. I'm sure I was guilty of thinking the same of people my age now when I was their age although I do feel like ageism is much more rampant and socially acceptable than it used to be then again we didn't have social media back then either | That's scary. I'm glad I haven't started my prescribed Lexapro yet | Sorry I misread it as parents. I'm sorry for your loss and my comment. I deleted it | That isn't it at all.  All the normals were told a lie and chose to believe it.  They were told that everything will work out as long as they are ""good"" people and never give up.  Unfortunately, we are cursed with knowing the truth.  That life is meaningless and random and that everything is basically pointless. | Oh I see sorry thank you for clearing it up | Thanks for the feedback I am considering it | I'm afraid to, been putting it off for weeks | I hope you are still around friend. ‚ù§Ô∏è | [deleted] | Don't do it- some one else's actions towards you Don't reflect on you or your value as a person. You deserve to live | Become a wise old man and dive into your pain, do not escape it. Experience it on the deepest level and use it to help others. You are in a unique place, your own place, the only one who is there as with all of us. Don‚Äôt cut it short. Let go of your suffering not your life. | please tell me you're still here. | I'm not sure if you're still here or not, but if you are, it looks like based on your other two posts that your wife was narcissistic and abusive? You should try hanging on just to show her that you can make it without her dragging you down! I know it's hard, I haven't lost a spouse, but I've lost a lot of other family, and getting through is hard, like the light at the end of the tunnel is getting further and further away, but at some point you learn to run faster and catch up to it. | [deleted] | [deleted] | hi, can we talk? | For someone whose contemplating taking his own life as I write this comment, I‚Äôm still here but not for much longer I assume. Whatever you‚Äôre going through I am too and we can go through it together brother, you‚Äôre not alone in this.

Never give up, never surrender to the abyss.üëäüèæ | I hope you‚Äôre okay | Thank you, but for me this is the end | Thank you, but I don‚Äôt want to be here without my wife. It‚Äôs not worth it I‚Äôm sorry | [deleted] | That‚Äôs seriously intense man. I can‚Äôt offer any advice except there are so many people out there that don‚Äôt think like your wife and ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. 

Massive respect for dealing with shit dude. I mean that. | Sorry, my friend you wife is a bad person. I also not gay and was touched against my will from a other guy. It‚Äôs a very bad feeling and yours is ten times worse. It‚Äôs not your fault. Psychological help can be good to deal with this. You should feel save and tell your partner what happened in a relationship. Don‚Äôt be ashamed what‚Äôs happened even if someone doesn‚Äôt understand. | Hi, you are most certainly not a joke. If anything, they are the joke because they don't know how to be decent human beings. I'm proud of you because you are so brave telling this. It's not a very easy thing to deal with but you're trying to in every way you can. 

But I think, you should find another set of people to trust. They're not really your friends if they think like that and they started making fun of you because of the trauma you've gone through. A friend should be one of those who you can confide to without them judging you especially during this time of your life. 

I hope you can find your people soonest and always remember that you're not just your trauma, you are waaaaay more than that. I know this is the hardest thing right now but I wish you heal from all of it. I'm proud of you and I'm rooting for you! | [deleted] | You need to ditch anyone who finds this funny or is comfortable making jokes about it. They are not your friends. You were raped ffs.
If that happened to my friend, I‚Äôd be pacing back and forth talking myself out of murdering the rapist. 

And I really hope you ditched your wife, disgusting behaviour. | Those are not healthy people to be around!!! It‚Äôs very normal to feel embarrassed and ashamed after being invalidated and made fun of for something horrible that happened to you. I‚Äôm no therapist, but i have been sa‚Äôd and went to a therapist for truama work so here‚Äôs my advice:
The moments after truama can actually be the most crucial moments. How people react to what you say can impact how you feel about it. Being told you wanted it??? Being outed even though you aren‚Äôt gay?? Those are unhelpful and toxic responses and you need to acknowledge that. You know you. You know what happened. They don‚Äôt. I hope you can accept that it‚Äôs not your fault what happened to you and how they responded was in no way support. Of course you‚Äôre gonna feel embarrassed and ashamed when those people are practically forcing those feelings onto you. I‚Äôm gonna tell you what they should‚Äôve said and i mean this.

I am so truly sorry that happened to you. 

Then to add on, i hope you can get to a place where this doesn‚Äôt haunt you anymore and i really hope you have other people in your life that are more supportive and empathetic. 

Remember that it‚Äôs not your fault too!! Ik victims can tend to blame themselves!! Don‚Äôt let these ppl trick you into thinking you did something wrong. 

Please please get some help if you can.

If not, remember to be kind to yourself. Do the little things you know you love. Surround yourself with the positive support. 

You are so incredibly strong and you will get thru this!! üíûüíû | True. I'd say the OP's so called ""friends"" are all big pieces of crap. Sorry not sorry. I just hope he can finally find the genuine set of people he deserves. | I'm sorry for everything you've been through but I know that changes none of it. If you manage, I hope you'll be without any more pain or trouble. | Dont do it. Share us your problem, what are you going though. | I am also coming it has been months | Hey, you probably don't believe it but you can actually feel better. If you want to take your life, you might as well give life one more chance but this time go away from whatever situation you are in. You can try to go to a community in nature. Or go to Denmark to a folk high school. I went to one and it was a magical place where everyone is accepted and where you can just have fun and make friends. Just try. Or just try to use all your imagination: what could be a place where you could be happy? Go there. You have nothing to loose. Go to a different country, there are special psychiatric places in beautiful country where you can actually just have a very good time and learn to be happy. There are options! Maybe people who you are surrounded with are not nice, but there are other places with nicer people who accept everyone. In my country there is a community which really is a magical place where anyone can go live for free and everyone is accepted. Sounds surreal but I made a documentary about this place so I can tell you more about it. People who live there told me they didn't find a place in society, but they found home outside of society in that place. Hope you are still here to read this | Hey, idk if you are there anymore, but I hope you lived and we all love you. | Please don‚Äôt, I feel so depressed too, but go somewhere and realize it‚Äôs not worth it . Start a new life doing something different | I hope you didn't do that and changed your mind. | Only do it if there is really no conceivable way out of your situation | [deleted] | Dont do it man. There will always be light at the end of the darkest tunnels. Dont let that light be an oncoming train | This girl I was friends with killed herself in 2017. Found out years later through other friends she did it bc her girlfriend broke up with her. That girlfriend is now married to another woman, as you do obviously. But Chloe is dead now. It‚Äôs been 7 years, and if she hadn‚Äôt done that who knows where she would be today, I imagine getting married and starting her own family. Wish she‚Äôd waited for it to get better. | [deleted] | [deleted] | Thank you. | Im still here! I really do appreciate all the comments, although I feel i dont deserve it all | üíó | Im still here | I trust you! | Im here :) thank you so much | i  hope youre happy with whatever decision you make | I hope youre doing better! | I dont know tbh. I struggled with depresson for around 4 years, last year i healed (fully?) But all of a sudden ive been getting really bad paranoia and anxiety and i keep sabotaging the relationships around me, Im just confused what to do, i cant deal with it | Thank you so much, I've fought every day for so many years, it gets boring eventually, but I trust you, thank you. | I will! | Drop me some of ur favourites! And thank you! | I dont have any friends or a 'circle' idk what that is but thank you! | I am! Thank you ü©∑ | Ill stay with you | Thats why i posted it. I needed someone to stop me, because no one would in real life. I never expected this much attention but i appreciate every single kind comment, and i hope it can encourage others not to do it too | I love u too üíì | I wish i was but im not, thank you though, i appreciate it! | Im a minor | Im glad i made you feel better üíó i hope everything gets better soon | Im sorry to hear that, i hope you feel better soon and thank you, goodluck to you too ‚ù§Ô∏è | Im glad you care about me, thank you! and a heart ü©∑ :) | ‚ù§Ô∏è | ü©∑ | Idk i keep feeling a really odd presence around me and its a weird feeling i cant shake off it feels like someones following or watching me and its terrifying | Thanks! And ofc | Thank you so much | 16¬∞C here! Its a nice breezy weather! | Thank you so much i hope ur doing better now | Its like this all the time in the uk tbf! | [deleted] | This might not work, but something that worked for me when I was younger and had the same mindset as your daughter was picking a TV show to watch with my parents. One episode per week on Sundays. That way I had something to look forward to each week and something that gave me pause when I was engaging in self-mutilating behavior. I also read a lot of books and got started in video games. | I hope it gets better. Sending wishes. Praying for you guys. | No judgement just love her and be there for her. You‚Äôre doing so good paying attention to her. And it‚Äôs such a win that she told you about it!! I cut myself for years at the same age and my parents were so naive and self centred they actually believed me when I said it was from the cat scratching me. Maybe they just didn‚Äôt want to believe it or deal with it, so good job on you taking it seriously and listening to her. I had to grow up really fast too and trauma just does that to you. Be a kid with her but always be her parent and keep working on not letting her be the parent. Take care of her and always be available for her and to her and always take her seriously. Not wanting to exist is ok, life is overwhelming. Cutting lets her feel something, feel alive. Do things to make her feel alive and validate her feelings. You got this. | I am horrified thinking my dad will do the same cos he keeps saying he will after every argument with anyone for years and that affected me a lot cos i was really young and i still am. | Thank you, thank you very much. I have a feeling that I will come back to reread your response occasionally as it helped reign in and calm my racing heart a bit. Thank you for your sincerity, your story and for your kindness. | Thank you kindly | Hi üëã could you please elaborate on this? I‚Äôm in trauma therapy by a therapist that swears on CBT and I am struggling to get past things. Could you tell me how it‚Äôs harmful? I‚Äôll look up the dbt and emdr but very curious on why the CBT is not helpful on trauma induced mental illness. | Well she really needs to meet me cause I‚Äôm a gigantic baby¬† | ""Self-soothing behaviors"" - Absolutely, I never thought about it this way. | Lol | Thanks a lot for your reply but you know what, in a way, she kind of hit the nail on the head :-/
I do feel like a helpless baby in a world a adults even at the age of 42 ... | Yes indeed, changing my diet is key. | Thanks a lot üôè | I have a bipolar diagnosis and I'm already on medication. | I don't know actually, I technically do live like a 42 year-old baby :-/ | Absolutely correct, you describe exactly how I feel. The therapist is one thing but my psychiatrist is even worse : I told her I had thoughts of death to which she replied ""we all have to die one day"". No kidding ! | Y'a plusieurs √©l√©ments et param√®tres ... | Merci beaucoup üôè | Yes maybe ... | Life is a tragedy if you realize whats going on. Its great if you‚Äôre an imbecile though. I suggest frying some brain cells. | I hate the fact we are forced into life without a choice and we must suffer. It‚Äôs horrible. I wish I wasn‚Äôt born. | For me, it should also be something natural to discuss. I know the world is perverse and disgusting, but it also has good experiences, nourished with pleasure and good sensations. You know, the good only exists if the bad exists in return. In the same way that light does not exist without darkness. I want to have a lot of pleasure in this life and make my dreams come true. But then when I get to 60, I want to jump out of a plane or something, and die quickly and emotionally. I also don't want to die wasting away. | maybe one day we could transfer our consciousness to machines, and we'll live till the heat death of the universe. | same i fele gaslit all the time about morality, shoulds and musts, about life. ive come to the conclusion the most merciful thing is a quick peace extinction of all humanity or even life. | Live like what you want, everything must have a dark scene behind it, that's life and you can't avoid it. What I'm trying to say is there's always ying in yang ‚òØÔ∏è, it's just the view point that you're seeing. | Oh why hello there | its normal when u don't now reason for life and why we re here |  I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way. There is so much hatred and sadness in this world, you sound very jaded and well informed. It is important to take the time to enjoy the little things and not overwhelm and ruminate on things that you cannot control. 

Try taking a deep breath, a glass of cold water, nourish yourself and I dare you to take a walk in nature. There is still so much beauty around, nature is where I try to put my focus as it‚Äôs incredible to see the variety of blooms and greens, the fresh air is helpful, and having a small garden that I can tend helps keep me grounded. 

We are all different , but if you are seeking happiness it may be time to push your focus on what you can control and what you want to do - there are many paths that can help bring you peace, however it‚Äôs up to you to find which one speaks best to you. 

Good luck op, I hope today is better than yesterday for you. | I wish I was stupid so I didn‚Äôt think of this kind of stuff so much | Sounds like a man without purpose. Find you a purpose and you‚Äôre good. | Some people manage to live knowing this. But I can‚Äôt | You can also opt to view it as comedy rather than tragedy. Helps take some pain away | Yeah people should be more responsible about choosing to have kids | Yeah every day I see them. It drives me nuts | It can happen anytime tho. Even when you‚Äôre young. Cancer and stuff | Well if your life‚Äôs gonna be so good and pleasurable I doubt you‚Äôd want to jump out of a plane cause you can still enjoy life when you‚Äôre 60 | Me who has anhedonia: üíÄ | Yeah I don‚Äôt like that we get dirty too. I hate gaveling to clean myself everyday. Like showering takes so much time and taking care of yourself takes so much time | That much? | What did she say? | Yeah I‚Äôm learning stuff I have hobbies. I don‚Äôt have energy to pour myself into it | [deleted] | No thanks I wouldn‚Äôt want to live that long | Good for you. Well I binge eat a lot because I‚Äôm depressed and sad often. But also there are people who smoke and they still live till they‚Äôre 90 | I‚Äôm kind to everyone but myself | I‚Äôve watched plenty of vids they still didn‚Äôt make me heal or anything. I don‚Äôt talk to many people. But how can I remove myself from nasty people? They surround us every day whether you like it or not | How can I ever forget these thoughts. Even when I‚Äôm not depressed. I notice beautiful things. It‚Äôs not like i see world like trash. I like animals and nature | There are happy things I know but what do we do about unhappy ones? | Only to be back here again 3 minutes later | I go to the park. But I can‚Äôt get off it that easily cause I talk to people. And I search for information. But honestly before I posted I saw some gruesome car accident pics so it made me feel that way | All I see is rubbish when I go out. People who throw rubbish on the grass people who don‚Äôt care about environment or just clean outdoors look . Air isn‚Äôt fresh. There are always construction works and toxic smelly paint that they use to paint everything for whatever reason. I‚Äôd love to move somewhere like a countryside and leave the city one day | I notice beautiful things but they can‚Äôt overlap all the bad things. I love everything already | Yeah my grandpa died recently and when we were at the graveyard they were digging so many graves | What she thinks? | People always complain when it‚Äôs cold then when it‚Äôs hot | Well I think it should be changed. People can‚Äôt just continue being awful | Well I think it‚Äôs just people who make it disgusting. It could‚Äôve been more beautiful than this | I have purpose and hobbies | I try to do things that I enjoy. But they don‚Äôt bring me that easy joy cause I always overthink things. I have a purpose. It just doesn‚Äôt bring me that much joy and I lose the point of it I lose the meaning of it. Why I‚Äôm doing it. What for. I‚Äôm even scared of relationships I can‚Äôt get a boyfriend I don‚Äôt trust people... I can‚Äôt see a therapist because I wouldn‚Äôt even capable to open up | I‚Äôm not the one I want to change. I don‚Äôt behave rude I don‚Äôt literally I don‚Äôt do no harm | I go to work everyday. I‚Äôm tired of people.  I‚Äôm exhausted when I come home because I‚Äôve talked to so many people and I‚Äôve been anxious for my entire day. Everyday. I just pass out. I rarely have energy to do things I like. I can‚Äôt do nothing! I‚Äôm not contributing anything wrong to future generations. It‚Äôs other people who do that | thats why we fry the braincells | Yah they say comedians tend to come from traumatic circumstances. | It's not remotely funny! | Screw inner strength | There is treatment, don't hesitate to seek help.

Your body is a chemical computer, if it has deficiencies, you will need to replace it with appropriate medications and therapies. | I like art too but I always feel like I‚Äôm not good enough and it makes me more depressed | reminds me of the logic project in fear and hunger | It‚Äôs been a fallen world from the start, biblically. It‚Äôs just how it is. We each must find out how to cope | Lots of young people get cancer too | I guess you‚Äôre just scared of not knowing what it‚Äôs like to be 60. But ppl in their 60s are still pretty much independent and live full life. It‚Äôs not that old at this day and age | You're right. I'm at it! Been in therapy atm. I've been seeking help for months now. Seeing any sorts of doctors. Still nothing. I try to stay motivated so I don't completely go mush. | No I think because I‚Äôm sad and anxious all the time I worry too much and it leaves me exhausted | I‚Äôm sorry have you heard of peaceful death?? ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | I mean anything. People swear men spit on the ground people litter. People who are rude. I can‚Äôt cut them off. All the people I work with swear and I hate it. I see men spit on the street all the time. Many people would underestimate what I like doing and I hate that too | Depression is an illness. Anxiety is an illnesses | When happy times arrive I can‚Äôt stop thinking that they are gonna end. I just want to be at ease all the time but I‚Äôm always anxious . I see good and acknowledge it but I wish bad things didn‚Äôt get in a way | I thought having a boyfriend or friends change that | yo thats sick |  I hope you find existential meaning. I suffered with depression for many years, and I still have relapses. But I'm still here. I hope I don't sound like a moralist here, and I wish you all the best. | I mean with the ton of construction works that they do too it‚Äôs getting more and more toxic here | No it's fine! Thank you for being supportive üíï | I don‚Äôt see other people struggling like that they talk to each other laugh and take everything easy. Yeah they might have problems but it‚Äôs not compared to depression like its chronic loneliness. Most people don‚Äôt have that. Most emotions come and go. My loneliness stays all the time | I mean the people I see everyday at work how they talk to each other. And everything. I‚Äôm always a strange one whenever I go. Shy don‚Äôt talk. I‚Äôm scared of therapy too | Everything is so fucking true man, except I'm gaining weight. And they hurt so bad, everyday keeps repeating itself. | [deleted] | A lot of those aren't really from depression per se but possible consequences of the behaviors it encourages.  


That said, depression hurts worse than anything else I know of. I suppose really bad burns would be worse.  


But I'm going to reframe it and point out, based on my experience, that depression is also a super-power: I have, easily, the highest pain tolerance of anyone I know, and the tattoos to prove it. Because, compared to depression, having ink needled in along the bone is a day in the park. Depression makes every other problem seem minor.  


And there is a flip-side of depression: The same obsessive tendency that makes me keep revisiting the things that pain me, remembering my ex-wife, revisiting my divorce, is also what makes me so good as a software engineer/architect -- I keep turning things over in my mind, looking for the seam, for the way in, for how we solve this puzzle. (There is a strong correlation between depression and creativity/analytical skill... I don't think that's an accident. Depression is the downside of an otherwise invaluable ability.)  


Depression has to be managed, for sure. I don't want to stare at the wall for hours at a time, as I literally did during divorce. But it's also part of what probably makes you amazing, if only you could see it. | You as well. Thank you. | [deleted] | That's totally unethical, against the therapists code. He must be reported.
Sorry you have to deal with this.. | That's terrible. Therapists are not supposed to do that. They are getting paid to help you. You are not being a waste of time, he's just being unprofessional. I suggest that you switch therapists and probably report him. | I think your therapist is a waste of your time, my precious buddy. That's it. | What an asshole. How come he/she got a license? | Your therapist is a dick. | What a fucking awful thing for him to say to you. You had every right to walk away in that situation. | That sounds like super out of his job.

It's like hearing a aircraft engineer say he/she wouldn't do metric to imperial or imperial to metric conversion because it is a waste of time. I give you no blame. Don't feel guilty. | Had a similar experience like that too and was told by her, that she couldn‚Äôt help me | My therapist dropped me like the sack of shit that I am | I'll probably be a waste of there time too. You pay into it if they like they'll help, of they don't they'll be subliminally cruel. I have an appointment coming, it'll probably go nowhere | It's weird that a therapist would say that. | well he kept asking me questions like whether i see myself staying at my school or not as i had told him that i didn‚Äôt like school and that the deadlines were causing me stress. i didn‚Äôt know the answer to the questions so i just said that i didn‚Äôt know, i wasn‚Äôt trying to not give him anything to work with i was just answering honestly, im a very awkward person | i‚Äôm not throwing him under the bus and i don‚Äôt want him to get any hate from people | if you go in with that mindset then it will go nowhere, make sure you keep an open mind bro and just do the best you can | Been there. I remember being about 14, watching my parents stress over money, realizing that wasn‚Äôt something everyone had to deal with, yet it would probably be me one day too.

You‚Äôll meet people that make the struggle worth it. | Im 22, i felt the exact same way till my school finally gave me money. Now i wanna live. | I hear you I spent my childhood living and seeing family and friends in poverty, having health issues needing rest and not being able to have it. Needing a reason to keep going and not finding one but life isnt all about money. In fact I believe its about suffering in a way. Whats sunshine without the rain. Nothing good comes from comfort and pleasure. The more comfortable and pleasurable your life is the weaker you are. People couldn‚Äôt even survive without climate control these days, is that really a good thing? Pain and suffering can build you up strong if you lean into it. Good things take time and you cant help anyone if you cant help yourself so dont be afraid to be ‚Äúselfish‚Äù in a way that leads to something better. Idk if Im out of context with the stuff Im saying but Ive been there and I feel for you except nobody ever gave me any advice except ‚Äúyou have to go to college if you dont you‚Äôre a failure‚Äù and that stuck with me and ruined my confidence for a long time. If someone like me can go from a homeless drug addict felon to making $80,000 a year to working for themselves from home ANYONE can do it. It takes 10 years whatever you want to do at first seems impossible or unrealistic but if you just go through the motions and keep doing it eventually you‚Äôll begin to understand then you learn then you become valuable. Just know the joy you‚Äôre looking for is in the pain you‚Äôre avoiding. I know you‚Äôre young and it seems so far away but trust me time flys and you will ALWAYS wish you had done more looking back. Consistency and doing the hard seemingly futile stuff is the key. I hope everything gets better for you in every way.

Edit: I just wanted to clarify do NOT pour your effort into a dead end job. Show up do what needs to be done and dont let them overstep the boundaries. You do need money but pour that effort into your health and skillset not some min wage job. | Better start trapping | Food pantries and Community Outreach centers are always available. I can do some research for you if you want :) | Welcome to the club.. learn to live with what u got | I second this i dropped and wish I had some more education to get a somewhat decent job. The only thing that sucks more than being a broke teen is being a broke adult. You‚Äôll be fine kid my advice is work hard now I always thought there would be more time and opportunities later on in life | True | Me too | That sucks, sorry to hear it. | The one thing I can tell you is that you aren't choosing this. | I'll turn 36 in a few months and can tell you it certainly does NOT get better with time. | I will save this post and wait for answers | Misery may very well choose you, but allowing misery to consume your life is a choice you make. It‚Äôs never to late to change your mind, mental growth and happiness is always possible but you have to want it and be willing to make uncomfortable changes to achieve it | awaken to the fact that you are destined to this, things wouldn't have been otherwise. | [deleted] | i have been diagnosed with depression since 6th grade and had trauma from my childhood to make things worse. its bad enough how i feel like i never got to be a young boy as a kid, i just never was a child to begin with. its painful to think about and it hurts knowing i never can go back. im in highschool, and im grieving my younger years, i wish i had a childhood, but im also grieving my teen years because i yet again and forced to grow up. i wish i can even take back my life in general. this is a cruel fucking joke that the world has given me and to others. is it such a sin or too much of a want to ask for the wonders that kids feel when exploring the world around them? too much to ask for me to just get a chance to hang out with friends? too much to even ask to get a chance to even live. is it that much of a burden to just get a chance to experience life and not feel like you're fighting for survival?

i just really hate the world for cursing me like this but also hate how im not alone in this. its a sick comfort knowing theres someone that can say they have felt like this. i dont believe in a god, parents/family are religious, but what kind of god would play this game to people? even more to have a child cry and beg on their hands and knees for a future where they can finally get some peace. its just fucking sad to live and grieve for what could have been | You are letting it steal your youth. Don't let it steal any further and enjoy your remining days | You should do something about it | Too real | I know it doesn't make it better, I'm just pointing out that it's unfair for us to blame ourselves. Most of us can't help it, but it gives me a tiny bit of comfort knowing that I'm not choosing to be like this.

I was actually on a path to healing last year, at least that's how it seemed, but then my dad suddenly died and I went spiraling. Now I feel 10x worse than I did before that, which I didn't think was possible. | Doctor says there is nothing else they can do, maybe therapy. Therapist said it's unethical to keep seeing me since I'm not making any progress. I have PPD and MDD (known as double depression) among other problems. | My depression has been completely treatment resistant. Being in patient for depression is horrible and probably does more harm than good. | Hadn't heard of it before. Did a quick search, sounds like depression isn't what it's primarily used for, but no I have not had my skull cracked open and electrodes implanted. | In the same boat. My best friend stop talking to me all of sudden too so that didn‚Äôt help very much. Can‚Äôt share anything w my boyfriend cause when I do it‚Äôs ‚Äústupid‚Äù. Lmfao just here taking up space in this world. | [deleted] | Everywhere you run to - there you will be. This life is fleeting but we have to make what we can of it. I feel this way too but I am hopefully there is something else that makes the wait worth it | Don't do it, you need to take a break and go on a vacation if you can. If not find a mental health counselor and talk about what you're going through. Or at least call a trustworthy friend or family member. | [deleted] | Man that isn‚Äôt it | lol you helped me when you said that ducks in the parks will listen to us all. thank you for saying that. it truly helped me and i am in a deep depression right now. and you helped me a lot because maybe tomorrow i will go the park and talk to the ducks! frfr. <3 thank you | But you can make it through..
You aren‚Äôt alone. Don‚Äôt suffer in silence, though it is easier to do so. | hi! thanks so much for replying to me. you truly helped me so much with your ducks idea frfr.  i will always remember you when i go to the park and talk to the ducks! <3  i hope you have a very nice day today and thank you again so much. | Well I'm sorry that has happened. Don't put yourself down my friend. I was a bit blunt but don't give up. | [deleted] | My dog, cats, dad, and husband keep me alive. If they were to find me like that‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt even want to think about it, but with them I‚Äôve gotten to live a life I never would have expected. And I love them unconditionally for that | A big thing that kept me alive through some really dark times until I was able to get treatment was just this stubborn sense of curiosity. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going to happen next. I need to know‚Äù | That's been my whole existential crisis in a nutshell.  I can't really think of anything to stick around for personally.  I don't really want a family of my own or a relationship or anything like that.  Don't care much for travel or seeing the world.

Life is a party I was forced to go to, am not having fun at, and somehow it's rude for me to want to leave. | Same brother | Thank youüñ§ | I'm so sorry.¬† I can truly empathize:¬† I killed one of my sisters and arguably my mother.¬† It's been a very long time for both, but the guilt and shame never goes away.¬† I so wish I had something good to say to you; but all I have is that you were trying so hard to do the right thing in many different ways (because the responsibilitiesof a caregiver are vast **and** you were working on top of them), and that matters.¬† It may not feel like it does, but it does. | Work on forgiving yourself. Work a 12 step program and do it every day for the rest of your life if necessary. This belief you k!led her is k!lling YOU. | [deleted] | [deleted] | I listen to a lot of grunge music, I find it therapeutic because I can relate so much to the feeling. I subconsciously am really hard on myself yet I speak up when I need to. I just build upon my strengths little by little. I hope you find people to connect with, or at least something that interests you like music or mysteries. | [deleted] | [deleted] | Since the first day of my life, I have been the same way. | fuck you | I don't want to go to Therapist, I don't want my family to know | [deleted] | Yep. Mine has been gone a long long time. Happens more as you get older also | I feel you sighs.. | Same. I‚Äôm just simply existing in pain. | Covid may have a hand in some, but i feel for most of us life has just dealt a really shitty hand‚Ä¶ Covid really had no effect on me, I had no friends before Covid, I have no friends now‚Ä¶ my interests have dwindled due to circumstances beyond my control and life has just beat me down at every turn‚Ä¶ 

 I often Joke that even a global pandemic, killing millions, doesn‚Äôt want me‚Ä¶ | [deleted] | I‚Äôm 34 and I feel like my life is just beginning. Don‚Äôt make that a goal post. Instead think of ways you can be the best version of yourself for the person who is coming your way.
Ps: suicidal thoughts are only thoughts. They come like a storm and they bring us down from time to time, but they are only a storm. I have come to accept suicidal thoughts are actually normal as this life is hard. Accepting and even becoming curious of your suicidal thoughts helps me. I‚Äôll ask myself: what are these thoughts telling me about my emotions and desires? What can I do to make things better? How can I better cope with things and how can I focus on things that uplift me? | Please don't ever do it, if you ever need someone to talk to, I am here for you even if we don't know one another. | The pain will go away in future you should not forget but it will go easier. | Nah it makes sense to do it tho¬† | I've been in a relationship for 20 years and I can tell you it brings you no solace. Im even more suicidal now than I was before. Please don't get into the mindset that a relationship would help you cause it could very well have the opposite effect. Some people are just broken inside no matter what. I know it's easier said than done, but other people will not make you happy, you need to make you happy. I find im better when im alone, when people are around I hate myself even more.¬† | I made the love of my life attempt suicide, and to cry many times, I hated myself quite so much for being unkind to her feelings, I realized that to correct everything is to seek myself, and change my behaviors, She'll be forever carved in my heart, as I don't want someone else, she broke up with me for making her miserable, I really promised myself to not give up on her no matter what, and thats what im planning to do, I hope you will find yourself, seek your self, when you are happy with yourself, you will find everything at ur feet. | I‚Äôve been hoping to find that person for ten years now. I give it a few more months, but that‚Äôs all I can take | The relationship did nothing but absolutely FUCK with my head and my heart.  it ruined me. I was looking for something my whole life, given it, and ripped out to nowhere. And now I‚Äôm 31, almost 32, and single as all fuck. I don‚Äôt know whether to focus on how sad I am being alone or how much I miss him. I can‚Äôt do it for much longer. | Wow yes you get it | That must bring some comfort though eh? I constantly think about the past and I feel like sleeping in my teenage bedroom would bring me some nostalgic peace. My best years are gone and now I just simply exist. | I don‚Äôt know what more I can possibly do for myself. I‚Äôve tried everything. The only thing that ever made me happy was my relationship. | My family is the only reason I haven‚Äôt yet | I want a family of my own more than anything in the world | If every day is this painful‚Ä¶yeah I do unfortunately | I‚Äôm so sorry you haven‚Äôt experienced love like I have. It gave me everything I hoped it would. | Why? | lol are you single above thirty? If one more person to tells me have fun I‚Äôm gonna fucking slit my wrists. There are not endless people out there.Do you know how many days and years I‚Äôve tried to just ‚Äúhave fun‚Äù. It gets tougher and tougher when your fiends all go home to thier husbands and children and you are left to cry yourself to sleep. | This is stupid advice. Maybe it‚Äôs applicable to 18 year olds. | That‚Äôs nice for you. If you‚Äôve ever experienced love, it‚Äôs the greatest feeling of your life. It made every day of my life better in every single way. | Life‚Äôs sense of humour is grim and mostly just setting your hopes up for things never coming your way. | If the universe wants me to meet my person after 34, it‚Äôs too fucking late. I‚Äôll be gone. | Yeah I get that | Haha yeah he ruined my life. I wish I never met him. | Friends and family love will never equate to romantic love. Not to mention they all have romantic love of their own. | Happy for you, genuinely. Not for me | Unfortunately when I did have a partner, they did fill the hole in my soul and fix what I thought was missing | I have and currently do | What more can I do to become the best version of myself? I have a good job, I have friends and family, I‚Äôve traveled extensively, I‚Äôve gotten in shape, I‚Äôve tried new activities and sports, I read, I go out, I talk to strangers, I‚Äôm at my wits ends here | I have, didn‚Äôt help | Really than why does it happen for 90 percent of people? I will never not be chasing it, I want love. | That‚Äôs nice for you. Psychiatrist, therapists, medication, friends, family, hobbies, nothing has helped. | He didn‚Äôt do anything horrible. They were legitimately my soulmate. I‚Äôm glad you are able to be 36 single and happy, but that will never, ever be me. | lol what | I have and do, unfortunately is a bandaid on a bullet hole. No amount of medicine can fix this tangible, external problem. | I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs all I think about all day everyday. We never fought. We were so perfectly aligned. I never saw a single red flag. I have never, ever been happier. He treated me so well. He was so communicative.  

And yet, on a random Tuesday he dumped me out of nowhere, with no reason. I asked multiple times for any sort of context or reason, at the every least for self improvement,  but he said nothing.  ‚ÄúYou did nothing wrong, I don‚Äôt know, we just need to breakup. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if he really is going through something or he is just saying that, but that‚Äôs all I ever got. I was so lucky to finally feel this way, a love I have been waiting for my entire life, and it was ripped out from under me out of nowhere. I cannot do it anymore. | 27‚Ä¶Jesus I‚Äôm 31 | 27 is still too early. Middle age is readonable | I am actively looking, every single day. While I understand where you‚Äôre coming from, in a stereotypical advice sort of way, being in a relationship did give me everything I was looking for. There is nothing better than feeling connected with someone in every single way.  The laughing, the long talks, the activities on a wim, the excitement, making future plans, holding hands, snuggling, the small gestures of unexpected flowers or a compliment, knowing someone is there for you always | That‚Äôs just something people say. everyone just tells you to love yourself more, focus on yourself more, get more hobbies, try harder. It‚Äôs not true and it‚Äôs not fair. | It is for me | I disagree‚Ä¶.there is only so much we can do for ourselves. Human beings are meant to have love and shared lives. I experienced it and everything I thought it would bring me, it did | I‚Äôm more fit than I‚Äôve ever been. I probably dropped 30 lbs upon the breakup . But i workout everyday. I walk 10k steps a day. I socialize. I‚Äôm close with my family. I travel. I have a great job. I have a perfect apartment. I see a therapist and psychiatrist. I have close friends. I‚Äôve tried new sports, new clubs, new friend groups, new states, what more could I possibly do. | It‚Äôs only been few months, it‚Äôs too early to tell if they‚Äôre going to mess with you. Trust me whenever i felt this way, they quickly proved me wrong. Especially if it‚Äôs too good to be true. | [deleted] | Not true. | Wtf‚Ä¶I‚Äôm the exact same age with the exact situation | Honestly i understand you. Have you considered IVF and having a child and family of your own? | I wish. You don‚Äôt know that. I‚Äôve held onto hope for years and I‚Äôm over it. And while appreciate that, people are not meant to live life without romantic love. Friendship and family will never equate. You can have everything in the world, but loving yourself will never be enough | It suck huh. I‚Äôve told my therapist but I legit plan on telling my family soon to prepare them. | I think they shouldn‚Äôt talk to you¬† | She didn‚Äôt give advice, she was saying she feels similarly. | I‚Äôm not pregnant nor is it on the horizon anytime soon. Go away. | Maybe your comment is doing nothing for no one | Plenty of people for op to have sex with and hang out for a bit for sure, but that‚Äôs not what she wants. Most men in the 30+ singles dating market are single for a reason, most are avoidantly attached and either overtly or covertly scared of intimacy and commitment; or they have mental or communication issues. | Political stress lol, also definitely not substances. I wish there was something I could clearly blame it on. I don‚Äôt know. | 27 is still young. Do you have a physical deformity that makes you unable to date? Very low chance of that. | Please tell me what is possibly living for, I‚Äôm grasping for it 

It‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt find people interested in me. But I try and try and there‚Äôs few people I genuinely connect with on a physical and emotional level. I‚Äôm currently on hinge and raya, not to mention look in possibility in everyone I see. In the past I have tried tinder, the league, etc. I‚Äôve also lived in multiple states. I seriously cannot think of an avenue I have not explored. | I would advise you not to bully people who are talking about being miserable and thinking about ending their lives. | I don‚Äôt want to have a child alone, I want to have a child with someone that I love | I disagree. Friendship and family will NEVER equate to romantic love. Feeling that type of love is unparalleled. 

The problem is I am giving up. Every day is harder than the last. I have tried everything. I don‚Äôt know how much more I can take. | I see. I keep in mind that possibility for myself in the future. I gave myself a deadline to freeze the eggs in the future if i won‚Äôt get married. | No | How did she come into your life? | I have tried so hard. I try to love myself. I keep up my good iob. I make myself socialize every weekend. I workout everyday. I walk 10k everyday. I see a therapist. I see a psychiatrist. I try new activities. I‚Äôm close with my family. What more can I do. | Did you meet irl and do you live closeby? | I‚Äôve tried all the hobbies. Golf. Tennis. Backgammon club beach. What more can I fucking possibly do | You moved into a new country and didn‚Äôt speak the language? | I try every single day of my life. And I will continue to try until I turn 34. Then, I will end the suffering. | We are very different people, i do not play video games and never would meet someone that way. 34 isn‚Äôt young, i always wanted to have alot of children. I do not have another 3 years left in me of wanting to be dead every single day. | are you above 30 and single haha. I‚Äôm so tired of that advice. We are not meant to live alone. I can cosplay happy and satisfied to the outside world for another few years but the only thing that has ever made me truly happy is being in love | This is just the whats this system made of man its been made for make us suffer for primary needs (houses,cars,education,health) and availability for the products that will keep us living (drugs,media,food,clothes) we are made for buying those products rest of the life and suffer for buying a house | Too sad to live and too scared to die. 
That‚Äôs when you know that you are really in hell. | Ol‚Äô man River! Tired of living and scared of dying! | There there, let's be friends | Mate get off social media.. or at least reduce your intake of it.. go gym set some goals exercise and try better yourself . Only way is up. | How do you feel about alcohol? | Living the dream, right? | Yes. I am in hell, but im sure human pain is a bottomless pit, so i can always fall deeper and be grateful for when I could still see the light | Fr. Im getting a little ‚Äúfunned out‚Äù | Or down STFU really I'm the meanest dont fk with me over a screen come to my face¬† | <3 | Slay | Totally. A teenager might have more life experiences than me. All i do rot in my room doing my stressful job or just laying in bed | I know how you feel. Spent my late teens and my early to mid 20s in an abusive relationship and then my late twenties recovering and healing‚Ä¶ I sure feel like a new little baby going out into the world and trying to develop a career at 32!!! Even crazier still is that I am currently 5 months pregnant, and strongly feel that I now no longer have the luxury of indulging my low self-worth, low vibrational thoughts that bring me deeper into my depressions because I am shepherding a new soul into the world.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI have no money, my partner is not a wealthy person, I‚Äôm an immigrant to North America, my parents also don‚Äôt have money, neither will we ask for money from anyone. Life looks bleak sometimes! But I do believe it is a matter of perspective and working REALLY HARD to cultivate a better mindset. I‚Äôve already decided I‚Äôm not gonna kill myself, which means the only other option is to make things work while I‚Äôm alive. I‚Äôm focusing on manifestation, I AM affirmations (the words we use truly matter) and also making sure I choose good feelings over bad and I try not to live in my past, despite the fact that many of my mental and physical habits tether me to it. Help yourself! Every day. Be kind, be gentle. Treat yourself like the bestest friend you‚Äôve ever had because it‚Äôs true. Be your own best friend. Vibrate higher. Get up from the bed and try to do something different every day. Walks are nice. Being outside and breathing fresh air helps energy move along your body. It‚Äôs okay to be depressed. But it‚Äôs entirely possible to be in control of yourself and how you feel about life! | It‚Äôs said a lot but people make their lives seem better than they are online. Most people you know live the same mundane lives everyday. You spent your time in bed, they spent it at their boring jobs with few exceptions. Unless all your friends are rich jet setters. But I doubt that.¬†

But it‚Äôs also true that I am many others are working with less functionality. Like I don‚Äôt have kids. Many of my friends did. But I lack the functionality and stability. That fine though because I don‚Äôt even like or want kids. And I think some people are dumb to put themselves through that struggle.¬† | Sounds more like agoraphobia and social anxiety than just depression. I got over by simply forcing myself into social situation. I relied heavily on alcohol and other drugs like ecstasy for quite a while. But it did help me get over the hump and positively affected me long term.¬† | [deleted] | The one thing I can say is to maintain hope that things will improve one day. It‚Äôs hard as hell, and maintain that hope. It‚Äôs key, man. Speaking from experience | Whats i.e.d.? | [deleted] | I‚Äôm eating Taco Bell right now.

That‚Äôs the point.

I hope they don‚Äôt fuck up my order. | Life‚Äôs worth living because you never know what‚Äôs around the corner, each day is a new day. Right now it‚Äôs hard, I understand, but whose to say in a few months time you could be so much happier and begin to see the cup is half full instead. 
Friendships that are difficult, aren‚Äôt worth it as I‚Äôve learnt as I‚Äôve gotten older. The ones that are natural, effortless and caring are the ones you want around. Even if that‚Äôs just one person. 
Never give up, because we just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs around the corner. | I feel ya. It's actually kind of the opposite for me. It seems like so many things are wrong, that it makes me MORE believe that this is some kind of divine punishment or something. It started out with me being paranoid, like people are spying on me and actively trying to drive me insane, but it's gotten to the point where I think we are all either just lost souls on some outer layer of hell (like me), or demons pretending to be people (which is most people). Seriously I can't even iterate how many things are wrong, so incredibly wrong and the utter opposite of right. I feel like my head is going to fucking explode. I'm losing my goddamn mind. I feel like I've been r/retconned.

I keep praying to Jesus and trying to believe that he will save us, but I don't know. I feel like things are going to keep getting worse, ridiculously so. We are unfortunately in Hell.

We're just yelling into the void and some demon or demons pretending to be people will downvote me and try to argue with me but fuck it, silently screaming at the top of our lungs into the abyss is all we have anymore. | there is a point. And each person has a calling, even if they seem talentless. It's taken me years to find what I'm good at...but i understand not seeing a point to life. But keep marching on, keep fighting, stay alive.... you'll get through it | Thank you for reading my post and taking your time to reply. | [deleted] | You‚Äôre welcome! Smile!:) | [deleted] | This exactly. I especially hate when ""normal"" people always try to cheer you up or motivate you because to them, sadness is temporary. But for people like us? We're just born broken and have to live with the pain of seeing everyone else smile and laugh and play like nothing. People would only care because they need something from me, in real life I'm invisible. But also not invisible? Like they can tell I'm ""different"" so they just give me weird stares or treat me differently. Disappearing would be great. If I had the money to do so, I would lol. I'm afraid of driving so I never learned and I'm barely getting by in uni, shit's so damn expensive for no reason. Maybe some day we'll be free. | With all due respect, I've been searching all my life for that purpose. No matter what progress I make, it doesn't matter. I'm damned no matter which way I twist it. | I'm kinda exaggerating. I really just mean the person I was, the person I was meant to be. I'm nothing now. No personality, no hopes, no goals, no hobbies, no passion, no motivation. I'm just a ghost floating by, nothing but a side character in everyone else's story. But to be honest I'm not sure what ""killed"" me. Growing up I was never allowed to be happy, just to come home and get punished for being sad. I guess I just caved in. | This is gonna sound silly but someone told me once to snack on fruits and vegetables when I feel like this. It gives ya lil boosts of energy throughout the day and makes you feel like you did something good. I know it‚Äôs little. But just try it | Were being poisoned | [deleted] | i‚Äôm a fucking woman. | all i said was i‚Äôm not a fucking woman, and you continue to call me ‚Äúbrother‚Äù. this is not what gaslighting is. can you please just leave me the fuck alone? this sub is for those who are depressed/suicidal. i am both. and you decide now is the perfect time to pick an argument with me? and say i‚Äôm gaslighting you? (again, NOT what gaslighting is. stop throwing stuff like that around like it means nothing). just leave me alone. i‚Äôm reporting your comments.

next time, why not just not use words like ‚Äúbrother‚Äù. why not just address people neutrally? not everyone is a man. | [deleted] | yeah it is, because i didn‚Äôt come here looking for advice. i came here just to vent. i don‚Äôt want advice. and the last thing i want is to be called ‚Äúbrother‚Äù and belittled and told to get a job (i have one) and do x y z and shit that a thousand doctors have already told me to do. i just want to say what‚Äôs on my mind. | [deleted] | do you get some kind of kick of winding people up who are already at rock bottom? | that can only go so far with me | Not I. I need unpredictability in my life. I need movement. | I hate maintaining jobs and going out but it's better than sitting on ny ass. I wish I didn't have responsibilities either, they fucking suck and I hate being relied on so much. | Normal people have friends IRL, things to look forward to, a stable family, a good career, money to enjoy life, healthcare, don‚Äôt drink, do drugs, and generally live life without constant anxiety or suicidal thoughts.

Not to say they don‚Äôt have problems, but their problems are external rather than constant internal battles, crises, and panic attacks.

I think to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúnot depressed‚Äù is to have healthy outlets in life that allow you to move out of depressive thoughts. ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù people have too much going on IRL to even be depressed in the first place, they have plans, goals, healthy outlets, stability, etc. | I do be havin' trauma tho üëâüëà | [deleted] | I gave up on treatment of any kind for similar reasons.  I no longer have any ambition to get better. | I feel like most therapists are not very helpful, but this guy is off his rocker | Get that. I don‚Äôt have clinical depression, but when I‚Äôm going through periods of not being able to do anything I sometimes take multiple showers in a day.  I‚Äôll also have periods where I don‚Äôt shower at all | I shower more and physically take care of myself more than before but I would say I'm in a just as deep Depressive episode rn. | Total BS. Even in my worst depressive state, I'd still shower once a day (at least most days). Not every depressed person is dirty like that. 

Doing housework was another story though | I‚Äôm so sorry you had to hear this. It‚Äôs such bullshit, especially from a therapist. I can relate too. | Exactly, everyone is different. I didn't see her again after that. | I'm sorry that happened to you and they invalidated you. I hope things get better and you get a decent therapist that knows what they're doing. | I hate it when therapists compare severe mental illness to something ‚Äúeverybody feels‚Äù. Like, no, it‚Äôs not the same üò° | Exactly. I didn't see her again. You'd think these people would be well versed in all the conditions they could be dealing with. | Yes I think sometimes it's something do and feels comforting with the warmth. | I find it makes me feel better for a couple of hours. Smelling nice and feeling clean is a proper luxury to me. | Yes, it‚Äôs like when we‚Äôve had this condition for a long time we might behave differently in episodes or have more experience with dealing with them but it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre any less severe you know? | I stopped seeing her after that. Unfortunately I've struggled to find one that's a good fit but I'm currently coping quite well so not feeling I need one for now. | Exactly! And then there‚Äôs always the ignorant comments from people of ‚Äújust ask for help‚Äù and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm trying, but the help available is inadequate!! | I totally get this. | In all honesty it really is. If we stop bs ourselves we realize it. I did years ago. None of it really matters in the end | I could‚Äôve written this. 32, ex cheated on me w/ a bunch of women, impregnated me and then begged me for an abortion‚Ä¶ have a Masters in a field I hate and am somehow under qualified because of how poor the program was shit‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so lonely but terrified of dating again, think about suicide far too often but I‚Äôve been down that road a few times and it just leads to me spending a month a half in a hospital and rehab center, over drugged and desperate to get out. 

:/ I don‚Äôt know what the answer is. Regardless of where I am and how financially successful I am, I still feel the same way, at the end of the day. It‚Äôs just worse now that my darling cat is somehow‚Ä¶ gone. I wish there was an out. I‚Äôve been wishing that for years. | Used to think so myself, that we're nothing but a bunch of atoms and molecules incomparable to what's going on out there in the universe.

But when you end up serving time in jail / being conscripted into military / you name it, any time when they force you into some small numbered group - you do start to feel and appreciate such things, at least society | Realising how i isolate myself so i dont burden people I care about. Which means often I lose them sucks I know how you feel. They‚Äôll never truly understand. That‚Äôs the problem, they can want to help etc etc but they don‚Äôt understand. | i have felt like this and do feel like this sometimes to this day. it does get better, but its a rocky road | I feel like this is such a huge thing too. Relating to others and knowing you‚Äôre not alone makes it a bit more bearable. I wish you the best. | [deleted] | Holidays are terrible!! Also, I just lost 20 lbs in 2 weeks and I got compliments!! They knew I wasn‚Äôt eating for days. Thank god for depression starvation right? They don‚Äôt ever ask how I‚Äôm doing. If I ask a question, I‚Äôm ignored and no one notices how fucking depressed I am and they know i have it. it‚Äôs so isolating | it has to get better before it gets worse and everyones life is different | I hope to see you again here | I love you. I might not know you, but you‚Äôre a human just like me, and just because of that I love you. And I‚Äôm sorry that life has been so mean to you. I‚Äôm sorry that your friends behave like that. And I really hope things get better for you soon | In the words of Kimmy Schmidt, ‚Äúany person can stand just about anything for 10 seconds, then you just start on a new 10 seconds. All you‚Äôve got to do is take it 10 seconds at a time.‚Äù | heyyy are u there? let's try to talk about anything or everything, but except money. I'm from DR, where r u from?

Pls respond | Just like everyone else, I thought money was yout best friend. I guess not. Humans are still lonely creatures with or without money. | I‚Äôm dealing with it myself, your right it‚Äôs a very ugly thing | You‚Äôre very welcome! | Yea, I understand, I‚Äôve dealt with depression since I was 13. But I think it‚Äôs extremely important, to spread love, especially to those who don‚Äôt feel love themselves. Often times there‚Äôs so much bad and hate in the world that it‚Äôs hard to see the good and the light. And I think in times like those, especially with how the world is now, it‚Äôs important to stick together. And love one another. Because we are all human. And at the end of the day, that means something. We all feel, we all seek validation, and most importantly we all want to be loved. | And if anyone hasn‚Äôt told you recently, I love you bro. And I hope things get better for you. | I‚Äôm on SSI for mental health and I still don‚Äôt get taken seriously, until I attempted that is. I get made fun of, harassed when I attempted suddenly everyone wanted me. BS | From my experience.

An average person has difficulties relating to even simplest things like a bad vision (and this is really easy to demonstrate with blur filter of photos - ""Look, this is how person with low vision see without glasses""). 

And you expect the same people understand much less visible thing like depression?

You're asking for too much with this ü´†

I also noticed ""healthy"" people hate to do anything related to disease in others. As if thinking about it makes them feel bad. I think there should probably also be some evolutionary explanation for this. | For those with depression don‚Äôt see the ‚Äúdepression‚Äù itself‚Ä¶ for those who are not depression‚Ä¶ they can‚Äôt imagine ‚Äúwhat and how‚Äù does depression is‚Ä¶ they always misunderstood they are acting up or trying to get attention‚Ä¶. Awareness is very important‚Ä¶ | [deleted] | Yes, one day they will realize. | Yeah it's being normalized or they just don't care about people who have depression | This. | Yep, this. | People see me as a weak person and I don‚Äôt know how to explain it to them. | my sister told my mom that people like me are useless and won't win anything in life üíî | [deleted] | By knowing that you had no alternative. If you could return to the absolute lack of motivation you felt, where it was literally impossible to do anything, you‚Äôd realize that given how you felt at the time, you had absolute no recourse to anything else. And for that reason, what is in order for you is great sadness and compassion for the fact that you were in that situation, rather than anger about a situation you had no power to change. Depression is a tragedy, not a crime. | I‚Äôd suggest reading the Tao of Fully Feeling | [deleted] | craziest part is that you're expected to play catch up or perform while all of *this* is going on too

You're supposed to act like a normal person damn well not being being normal | [deleted] | Npc | It's rough. I don't really have the ability to ""relax"", so my days off work just feel wasted regardless of how productive I was. On my previous off, I literally drove to the hospital for an XRray, got a haircut, exercised, spent a lot of time calling and making appointments, helped around the house, so and so forth. No sense of peace or accomplishment, just delaying future stress.

Ironically, I got a week off work when Starfield came out (I'd been waiting for this game for like almost 10 years) and I played it for a good chunk of the week. Can't say I enjoyed that week off, despite relaxing. It's literally as if it never happened. Showed up to work the following week and went back to being drained and wanting vacation not even a month after the fact. Ranting aside, I think some of us desperately need a ""pause"" button for life cause nothing else is working. | [deleted] | Yuuuuuuuuuuuup! | You should try cross stitching, it‚Äôs very satisfying and easy to pick up as long as you have pretty good eyesight. You said crochet, I like making amigurumi and it‚Äôs so cute! 

For myself, I decided to take adult ice skating lessons this winter because I always loved going with my ex but none of my current friends will go with me. Another thing on my list was to dye my hair myself. I just did it last week and it‚Äôs now a dark magenta. | I don‚Äôt know man. I don‚Äôt care about that. I already attempted so I just want my next attempt to be successful. Maybe before that I‚Äôll try and hook up with more men cuz why the fuck not. | Look into therapy and medication. Suicide is not a nice walk into the park I had a attempt because a illness and it was painful. If you have no deadly desease i cannot recommend it. Some people would be happy to be healthy. | Live ! Iost parents is the worst time of your life I wish everyone all the luck in the world and a support network to navigate thru the hell up down dark zones alone lonely times. No Job partner kids pets and I now have to continue on somehow ? | [deleted] | I have one friend since I was like 10. we tried to make friends numerous times and it always failed. I usually try to make friends online but they always move on in their life and I'm left alone. so yea recently I've came to the conclusion I'll stop trying, I need to find peace in being alone. | sounds like a good idea! | that's something I've dream about since I was a young teen but now I've just given up. I hope you'll find your soulmate tho | lol I drink occasionally and smoke. other drugs are illegal here and I'm not willing to go to prison for that üíÄ | omg I'm putting that on my list | I appreciate you saying that but it would be exactly the same. all I do is rot in my bed or room. the only ppl affected would be my friend and family but they're strong enough to move on | I've never flew in an airplane. ig that also goes on my list lol | [deleted] | Right | I'm in the same boat as you. Also 27, also terrified of turning 30, also feeling like I missed out on a huge chunk of my youth because of depression and anxiety. It's hard not to feel like I missed out on a lot of the partying, dating, social life and life experience that everyone else gets in their 20's and it's hard not to obsess over that feeling of wasted time. | Me too I‚Äôm 29 and it‚Äôs like living ground hog day I am filled with remorse and pain for what I‚Äôve done to others and I feel this is my fault | Am feeling like a burden too ND I feel like I have identity troubles and depression and anxiety and m only 19 and I feel like the shame of the family so no matter how bad it is remember that that is another person who wants to die before their 20 | It‚Äôs ironic cause I‚Äôve spoken to people who have everything in life and are clinically depressed so I conclude it‚Äôs not due to circumstances this is an illness that still no one can answer why it happens | I started planning a dream trip. I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôll ever go on it but I am approaching it like it‚Äôs actually happening, picking hotels, planning itineraries, looking up flights‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a bit silly and it might not help because I always assume things will go badly for me but tbh I look forward to doing it and it‚Äôs given me some meaning back as a goal to work towards. Idk if this could help you too | Anecdotal evidence | [deleted] | I hope you change your mind and hang on even by the tiniest thread of hope you might have OP, loads of love for you from another part of the world, you're valid, you're valued, and you deserve to live, it wasn't your fault you were born into the wrong house, I hope everything works out for you xoxo. | [deleted] | It's never gotten better. I want to die and will die. You're pathologizing | I've done everything to better my well being. Nothing ever gets better. I will kill myself. | you'd be wasting your time coming to this shit hole but I hope you have a good time if you do 

and you wouldn't want to hang out with me at all LOL | You wouldn't want to be my friend | I'm sorry you have found it hard in life. In a way, I'm glad I can relate to you but I'm also sad that we've suffered too? And thank you for finding worth in life.

I just don't see the point anymore. In anything. | it's too late my friend | [deleted] | Not a chance. Everything gets worse. It's time to die. | nothing ever does, imagine being 27 and never experiencing a true romantic relationship, being physically abused from a young age, having no friends to speak of and suffering physically and mentally every day but being told that things will miraculously get better 

the rope looks nicer and nicer every day | Being thrown across a room by my father twice | An ugly mentally ill person shouldn't be in a relationship, you're putting undue stress on yourself and your partner | Of course it brings relief. It stops the pain. It ends my immense suffering | I know free will is an illusion. I'm well aware of that. It doesn't make me feel any less terrible. | Good for you, genuinely, and you deserve that silver lining. 

I'm just at the end of my run. There's no home stretch when your life is constantly terrible and you have nothing to build upon but pain | The fact that he grabbed me by my collar and hurled my seven year old self across a room. Because I was struggling academically. | same deal | thanks | I have someone who understand what I'm going through. It doesn't help the pain. I'm going to kill myself one way or another. | looks fairly nice to someone who's new, but you get used to the same scenes when you've lived here for a while | That is the plan | Me too, honestly. I'm only 26. | I'm 24 and i've been battling for 13 years bipolar 2 with psychotic features and borderline disorder, i won't make it to 30 for sure, no therapy or medication helps | Life is so relentlessly difficult when you're right up on it. Wiggle room. Find your wiggle room.

And you're going to forget about the things that give you reprieve when you're in the mire. That's my hang up at the moment. I forget that I have discovered a bunch of things that help. It's so much easier to mourn all the opportunities missed.

I believe human life is precious. And not in some kind of ethereal poetic way. It can be that, but in a very practical sense we have the opportunity to understand that maybe all the maladaptive coping mechanisms we developed as scared children aren't helping us as adults. We can leave those poor coping strategies behind and pick up new upgraded ones. Proven ones. | I wish I could get one here in brazil | I'm sorry you feel this hopeless. I'm there too. I wish I could give you a hug rn | Strong man. Trying to get where you are. | My sympathies ü´Çüíî‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π‚ô•Ô∏è. | What pain do you have? Then I will tell you of mine. | Explain ur problem brother | chronic pain + severe depression + very abusive father and absent mother | I wouldn't ever make friends or anything. Me being suicidal and on the edge is going to distress anyone close to me. | Worst unsolicited advice I've ever read. Depression isn't something you can fix, it's a state of mind that has poisoned my well for as long as I can remember. I'm fine with death. Ending my suffering is fine by me. Ending everything is fine by me. | Suffering | They are absolutely not when you're an adult beyond his formative years and you're broken | There's nothing to think about. Nothing at all. You're not depressed. I am. You have zero understanding of this. Death is far better than living up to your age with this suffering. | Pain and severe depression | I cannot make friends unfortunately, the knowledge of someone being friends with a suicidal person will distress them regularly | I live my life. It just doesn't help me to live. Nothing does. | I'm going to. Thank you | [deleted] | Things get better brother. It can just take a really long time. Before u even want to commit suicide call someone to talk about, anyone. | 28 | Good for you, you're seventeen, living your formative experiences and learning how to survive with your depression whilst you still have the chance. Imagine being twenty eight and suffering with this shit alone since you were god knows how young. You have zero understanding of why I must kill myself. Goodbye. | I like feeling suicide because I like the idea of never ever living or existing. | I didn't choose to be physically abused as a child or experience chronic pain for a good chunk of my life | Ah ye but thats diffrent per country, in America a person would do that fast. But here in belgium no one would really. | Every other weekend | My heart hurts reading your words. I am so sad those who were supposed yo take care of you and protect you failed you. But this life is yours to do beyond what you have done up to this point. You can do more, see more, but I understand it must sound difficult or impossible. If I can give you a word of advice is to live this life for you, and give yourself the chance to maybe see those colors someday. Another thing is, weed and alcohol can cause severe depression. People with depression that get into weed and alcohol can worsen their symptoms, so if you decide to stay in this world please seek help regarding your weed and alcohol consumption. Big hug to you! | ""I've been told so many times how beautiful life can be if I just learned to see the positives in everything. It's like telling a colorblind person to ""just see the colors"". They don't exist for me.""

I'm realizing you either have to be ignorant to the problems of the world or compartmentalize them. Otherwise you'll go insane. | I can relate to this post so much man

I feel you! | [deleted] | At least you have something you're waiting for | Are you having issues with your parents? Honestly if that was the only issue you really don't have to wait that much longer | I can't imagine... I'm glad you're still with us | Thank you friend. Advice was certainly appreciated. | There is simply nothing beautiful about me in the physical sense when compared to the average person. However, word wise, it depends on the audience. The closest thing to Beautiful about me physically is the engravings on the navy cylinder, yet which it's body is weilded the ugly face of an adoscolent addict with a broken soul. For someone living in the country, not having my revolver is like missing a limb. It's a symbol of independence and freedom, my dedication to God and community. Yet that one thing I relied on to save my life ended up almost ending it. By chance of mechanical failure I survived, and what is chance without God? | Thank you. I see your going through some turmoil as well. My apologies about your situation and may you be healed. | And what about God? When do I get to enjoy his  blessings and want to accept the gift of life and be satisfied? When do I start living for a purpose other than just for heaven and the sacrifice of christ? When do I find  love? | [deleted] | They are part of my lifestyle where I live, and is valued in my  society as a symbol of our community and tradition. (Hunting, sporting etc)
And no, rest assured I am not a brainwashed far right hoodlum. I'm independent. But once again, it's just tradition and religion here. I'm a pure and hate free Christian. I understand and thank you for your concern.

I do believe what you surround yourself with influences your action and I agree with that. For now I just keep them in a safe or not right next to me until I'm better.

Thank you for the advice. | Thank you. | 20? You're not even old enough to drink yet. Vincent Van Gogh didn't start painting until he was 27. You could literally not have any experience playing music, pick a musical instrument to start learning, and become proficient at it and prolific songwriter and still be younger than a lot of famous musicians. You can do a lot, man, including learning to drive, getting a job, saving up and moving to a new city if you want, going to college. I know it's hard, and it feels like you have no way to do anything, I felt that way at 20 (I actually still do, at 37 years old) but you've got time. I envy your youth. | It‚Äôs never late to start your life! | Don't be upset about missing ""school experience"". It's nothing like the movies at least not where I'm from | Get your real estate license it‚Äôs quick and the money will come in. I‚Äôm 21 just went through the most unproductive 2yrs of my life consumed w this stupid ass depression. Started watching Jay Shetty on YouTube (and others)- very inspirational and motivated me to get the ball rolling. You can do anything you want in this life, just start. | [deleted] | It's not that I mentally can't. I might've gotten rid of a tumor but I have other medical problems. I can't drive due to a panic disorder and nonverbal learning disorder makes me extremely uncoordinated and bad at directions lol. I get lost going down on my own street and that's not a joke. I have about 5-7 disabilities that make it so I can't over-exert myself, problems that are already making walking difficult, and severe depression from all that shit lmao. I physically can't work. So I can't make money. If I can't work, can't drive, I can't get out there to try things, if I don't know anybody and nobody knows me, I have no one to rely on for help. I am medically gonna die before I'm 50. | Yeah but real estate agents are basically the bloodsucking lawyers of the housing business üò≠ | Actually I was really into studying languages from 12-17. Was nearly fluent in German, while learning Japanese, Chinese, ASL, and Italian. But the thought that I had been learning them for 5 years and STILL not fluent in ANY of them mad eme too depressed to continue. I had dreams of going to college in Germany by the time I was 20 because I was so sure I'd finally be fluent in at least two other languages but wasn't. I wanted to be a translator, work for the police, be a freelance language tutor, but I couldn't reach the point of fluency in ANYTHING | I had migraines and severe sleep problems as a kid, and at 6 I had my first MRI and it showed the tumor. No doctor in the nearby states would even think about doing surgery on a minor, but when I was 13 we got an email from a surgeon in Texas that was willing to do it, to help further his research. And at 15 we flew down and did itüòå me and one other girl who was 22 had the surgery at nearly the same exact time, healed together in the same rooms, and Dr.Kim retired shortly after to write his papers. | boohoo | Yeah I wasted every chance of talking to a new person and making a friend... It felt like people my age were so much older and well adjusted than me, because the last time I was actually in school or in public was when I was 10 and then I was suddenly 16 around other teenagers. The anxiety was so severe I had to stop goingüòµ‚Äçüí´ and I hate myself for it every time, since I didn't make friends in highschool, I have no friends NOW. | I've been on disability since I was 12üëå | Bro, you're gonna die anyway so you might as well see it out to the end. Think of all the great sandwiches you've still to eat. Yum!! | [deleted] | [deleted] | No. I'm going to kill myself one way or another. Life has never gotten better. I don't do pathologies. | Therapy's never worked for me ever | No. I've decided that someone else needs to kill me. My survival instincts keep kicking in | I'm just ending my suffering friend | cringe toxic positive platitude | Life has no meaning, my life is purposeless. | I'll try my dead tired and ornery friend | toxic platitude | I don't know where to get heroin or fentanyl, if I could inject either of those regularly I would | I already do this every day. It's not enough. No amount of gratitude journalling or soul searching or self improvement is enough | You realize that your 20s is a time for being stupid and immature. Don‚Äôt regret the past because each day you regret the past is another day lost to the same past you regret | I ended up lowering my expectations and standards of myself‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt do that. Do anything you can to avoid that toxic solution :(

Because it‚Äôs hard to escape it once it‚Äôs done | I felt the same cause all i did was eat and eat and got fat and wasn‚Äôt sexy enough to attract anything. I also just played video games all day. But now I realize that it wasn‚Äôt wasted time at all! In fact, I regret nothing now. All that delicious food was amazing! And I used my young fresh tongue and body enjoy it all to the max! Food pleasure is waaaaay better than relationships . Now I can‚Äôt enjoy it as much cause I‚Äôll get all sorts of health problems from eating too much, so im glad I enjoyed it all when i was young. So many fun memories of great pizzas! And I just don‚Äôt have time anymore for video games, so I‚Äôm glad I enjoyed that too back when i had time. What an awesome life I‚Äôve had! | I always wanted to write for a living. Back in college I won creative writing contests and got a couple things published. But the person who did that seems like it's dead now, buried under layers and layers of depression. Even if I could restart my creativity, my spark and my discipline, I know the people who get to write for a living are an infinitesimally small percentage, especially in the age of AI. Not to mention that I have zero work experience in the field, nor the financial means to try and support myself while waiting for success to arrive. | Easier said than done, especially when my present is fucked because of choices I made in the past. | But that's the thing. I didn't get to be stupid and immature in my 20s. I wish I'd been stupid and immature. All I got to be was depressed and lonely. | I feel like if I make some drastic changes and by some miracle I'm successful, I'm going to kick myself even harder and hate myself even more for not doing it sooner. | I get it I had to grow up way too fast in my teens and early 20s I was raising my younger siblings so I didn‚Äôt get to focus on my life. I still have hatred towards my folks for it but the only person that hatred was hurting was me and not them | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | I'm sorry brother | How did you come out of it? | Sadly yes | sadly yeah | Awful. Like always. | Thank you for the motivation | Tried all of that. It hasn't worked. Goodbye | You don't have to right to speak about this. You have a partner. A married husband. I'd kill for any kind of love but unfortunately I'm too mentally broken to receive or give it | Not anymore I don't :) | I don't want to try anymore, I've tried everything. Death is far better. | I'm going to end it, that's what I'm gonna do about it | [deleted] | Thanks. It's too late for me but thank you for trying. | With all due respect wtf does that even mean? | I don‚Äôt have understanding friends, I mean I literally don‚Äôt have any friends (and when I say I don‚Äôt have any I literally mean it - I pushed everyone away), I do however have my sister and my dog so I guess I‚Äôm half way there. My workplace is very money and profit based so they won‚Äôt be supportive at all unfortunately. I also can‚Äôt take time off work because I‚Äôm struggling financially as it is if I took time off I‚Äôd be homeless and that would just add to the problem. Did you do any counselling or anything or did you pretty much do it all on your own? | Like death | I'm a bit too far gone for friendship at this point but thanks anyway | I didn't say it was but your suffering is completely different to mine - you have someone who alleviates whatever hell you are going to. Reality, to me, is just raw punishment right now. It is raw chaos and I feel the torture of life trickling down me constantly. At least you have someone you can turn to for help, I cannot ever be helped and have nobody. I would love a romantic partner or wife but that will never happen | Exactly. | I've done all of those things. Why don't people read? I've done SSRI's, I've done all sorts of medication, I've done gymming, I've done everything. Death is far better. | I feel that. | No need for it when I die | The work is all on the inside, literally re-wiring your brain by practicing thoughts and drawings up emotions on command. Finding an emotional state that you can stay in through most any situation then building off of that. The answers to all our problems are very obvious, plain, and simple the hard part is just getting yourself to do them. | I hate them sm | I‚Äôm sorry, people are assholes, I honestly wish there was a way I could live without ever having to interact with people again. I‚Äôd probably feel a lot less depressed, contrary to what the majority likes to say. Forced interaction with other people for survival just makes my depression worse.¬† | I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the same guy, but yeah, I did see a very similar comment to that a couple hours ago.¬†

Yeah this behavior is weird, but not uncommon for Reddit sadly. A lot of people on this site seem to enjoy searching for struggling people and kicking them while they‚Äôre down. | Saw a comment a couple hours ago saying ‚Äúit sounds like these people just want to be depressed‚Äù | I understand, but it would be nice if people could be more supportive. It seems that we‚Äôre just expected to put up with sucky people alone most of the time. There‚Äôs no community at all in this society, it‚Äôs a huge reason why I‚Äôm depressed. | Stop gaslighting that person. You don‚Äôt know their situation better than they do. | I don‚Äôt agree with stoicism personally, I tried following it in the past and it just made me feel even more emotionally suppressed and afraid to be vulnerable¬† | I don‚Äôt think anybody should put up with those things you mentioned about life if they don‚Äôt want to. That‚Äôs why I support the right to legal euthanasia.¬†

I think stoically accepting these miseries of life is part of the problem, I think people should show their discontent more and be less agreeable. This artificial sense of ‚Äúpeace‚Äù we have in modern society is emotionally violent underneath, and represents a slow, painful death of the spirit in my opinion. I am into philosophy, and am an Antinatalist for the reasons I mentioned above.¬† ¬†

Observing my life and others‚Äô lives has also given me reason to believe that free will is an illusion. Most people believe in it because their survival instinct will give them an inherent bias toward any belief system that will make them feel empowered and benefit their survival. That doesn‚Äôt make the belief system objectively true though.

¬†I also think a lot of people use their belief in free will as a convenient rationalization for condemning and harshly judging people different from them.¬† | Thank you, I appreciate that. And many blessings for you as well. | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | Same, and my youth is gone too. ¬†I just live in agony in the waiting room of life. ¬†They should just humanely put me down like they do for sick animals. | What health issues you have? | Not a minute goes by when I don't think of the old time. The last time I was truly happy was back in 2019. | Tried enough. I am done. | I will be gone by the end of the year | [deleted] | Yea it's crazy how life can change. Years back if somebody would have told me that my life is going to get this bad. I would have never believed them. | [deleted] | Yea. I have made up my mind. I no longer believe in ""things will get better"". I will be gone by this year. | [deleted] | You can't rewrite the past so it's foolish to do so.

The question isn't ""What could my parents change?""

What are you doing to do?

You're clinging to the past and what is un changeable.

What will you do right now?

Take responsibility for the now. | Trying to prove an obvious hyperbole incorrect makes you look like a pretentious pedantic.

Never wanted to be born as in, this place sucks. And I wanna leave. That's it. | Why shouldn't I? She's the very epitome of a narcissist. She probably loves her foreign boyfriend that she met off of tinder more than her children. | This isn't an opinion? This is a personal experience and vent fym?? | Yes, nothing is exciting anymore. | One of my coworkers is always asking me why I rarely get excited. I don‚Äôt wanna ruin her mood by telling her the truth lol | What are you studying? Are you in college or school? | [deleted] | I already exercise very often and I tried socializing with people around me. It doesn't work. I also tried a bunch of different hobbies but I find everything boring and uninteresting. | I'm in school. | Wow, thanks, I'm cured. /s | [deleted] | I'm trash at meeting new people and socializing in general. The fire fighting suggestion doesn't sound too bad though. | [deleted] | Can‚Äôt do it. Just can‚Äôt do anything right. | I'm prolly gonna kill myself too except the only difference is nobody actually gives a fuck about me and it's just a matter of time... | Gonna do it now. Bye. Fuck everyone on this shitty planet. | [deleted] | I'm the guy that you just blocked, it wasnt my intention to get you mad, my computer turned off before I tried to cheer you up... if you could unblock me we could talk more properly, I'm really sorry please let's just talk. | u still here? | [deleted] | Okay. | I‚Äôm 18 and female but I can relate. People always say I‚Äôm intelligent when, by most measures, like exams, I‚Äôm not. In terms of life experience/wisdom realistically I KNOW I have more than most people my age, but they all think they‚Äôve got more because they‚Äôve been in relationships, basically, and treat me like a kid who has just been born because I‚Äôm in no way interested in being promiscuous. I find most people just have fake maturity. But I also have done things that are really immature due to mental illness. I hate it. | I mean I'm high as a kite rn but ok | Talk. | Another dickhead. | Fucking twat of a minor. | It depends who said it. If everyone thinks you are, then there‚Äôs not much you can do and you‚Äôll be ostracised even if you aren‚Äôt. | I‚Äôve been depressed for multiple things okay? This got to me. You sound just like my therapist. | We don‚Äôt want to forget about you. The world needs more people like you. Talk to me tell me about the pain | Please God don‚Äôt do this. One more day talk to me please | oh god reading ur letter...i just understood how kind hearted soul you are and definetly not someone you think you are try to do whatever you want to do and live ur life to the fullest to atleast one more year who knows what lies ahead of you.......if u dont have a purpose keep spreading love and help the poor people..thats all i wanted to say you definetly are one of the most kind hearted people in this world.......even after all this.......i hope what you are looking for i hope you find your happiness.....peace little soul | thank you this is really sweet of you. i haven‚Äôt told my family yet because it‚Äôs really hard to bring up but im doing much better now | thank you! i‚Äôm still here :) | thank you so much, i‚Äôm still here and okay and this means a lot. i hope you‚Äôre doing well too! | hello yes i am. i‚Äôm sorry for worrying everyone | i‚Äôm still here, we can be friends :) | thank you so much for your advice! i‚Äôm still here and okay and am around if you‚Äôd like to talk :) | thank you! i am | thank you so much!! i‚Äôm still here and okay :) | thank you so much. you‚Äôre an amazing person. i‚Äôm still here and okay :) | thank you so much. i‚Äôm here and okay | thank you this is very sweet of you to say :) | i am still here and okay, i‚Äôm so sorry for worrying you | hello, i‚Äôm still here and okay. i‚Äôm so sorry for making you cry | thank you, i‚Äôm sorry for not responding earlier. i‚Äôm still here and okay. thank you for your concern :) | i‚Äôm so sorry for worrying you | This made me so happy | omfgg i m literally soo happy reading this reply...u made my day....btw i too am 17...ill lead a ear if u want as ig m a good listener..stay strong buddy ;) | I am lost at 36 | lost at 27 here | It‚Äôs completely normal. But the beautiful thing is, you‚Äôre so young. You have lots of time. I‚Äôm 41, and just starting to figure things out. | Thanks, I'm gonna try my best | Thanks | Thank you ü§ó | Thank you I wish you too ü§ó | Mom said it's normal I am just young is that okay I mean I tried to overdose twice | yup i do ! but eventually if you keep thinkin bout it it‚Äôs most likely gonna happen. | Can we talk? | I do need someone to relate to but just so you know I suffer from mental I'll was it's not because of an event that happened in my life | How did you guess my mom has something to do with it I mean it's true but I didn't mention it | I have ocd with food I don't know if it counts every dr say I am anorexic but I am ocd about food not at all with weight loss | I see a therapist but it on another matter should I tell him this? | No | I wanted to die on .y birth date but not an option because I get more attention than usual that day and I don't want To be interrupted | That's fine it's just different when it's because of mental Illness I am sorry for your wife though I sure she would want you to be happy | I do but food is the most noticeable by others that is why it's the one I know most about | I am scared he won't believe me | Or think I am stupid or overreacting | I go to one he only said I need positive therapy because I am at huge risk of self harm | [deleted] | You sure you‚Äôre depressed, or do you just not have friends to spend every day with? | Exactly, and if it‚Äôs biologically idk, but I really think my depression comes from practical reason I can‚Äôt have the power to change them still.

So I just try these simple things and seem they don‚Äôt help, therefore I will just let time pass. | Same, I don‚Äôt let the symptoms act physically, as to affect my work, and stop my life or quit something.

But they are there mentally only. | ‚ÄúI still was ok with the idea of it ending, it‚Äôs just all we have‚Äù I felt this | Same it‚Äôs really getting worse as I get older, I think the only positive thing that come with it is that whatever happened in life, I just don‚Äôt care because I already don‚Äôt feel much anymore | *hugs* | Only physically I keep going

When most times I don‚Äôt get a satisfaction, then
I just do life and things for the sake of doing only

cuz at the end I‚Äôm still alive and what else I would do?,
then I do them with no satisfaction just to waste time,
Until life gets better from practical reasons, since that the only things available | Same tbh, kinda practically better

I also still do my usual hobbies and work even if they make me feel good or not.

Thanks for checking, I appreciate it.

What about you, how you been doing? | It‚Äôs not the case at all with friendship, I do tend to make friends easy.

And I have friends from work, university | I don‚Äôt even try explaining it to who can‚Äôt relate to it,
they would blame you somehow or tell you to try what you already tried,

Only who is in it knows the reality about it | Real friends? Cause how could you hate life with treasure like that?

True friends make life worth living. | Maybe, I think allot of it is situational,
as I never could be out of them, and experienced otherwise | Yeah you are right, I don‚Äôt have CLOSE friends,

It‚Äôs would be fun around friends that are close to you | Looks like your next focus should be on creating a meaningful friend circle and having fun experiences. :)

I suggest your next hobby should be a girl‚Äôs team sport. Like volleyball or softball. Get a group going around that, and you‚Äôll have energy, sisterhood, and positive endorphins.

Who knew the secret to the good life was playing games outside with your friends. | I have close friends, and I play basketball. The problem with depression is that it twists your mindset, everywhere you seek confirmation that no one likes you. It's a constant mental battle with yourself. With time, you start alienating those around you with your negativity, and they stop wanting to spend time with you, or just drift away. To bring them back, you need to make an effort, but seeing your friends drift makes you sadder - it's a vicious circle. | But that‚Äôs just it, close friends would prevent something like that from happening.

When you know people care about you, and they let you know they love you too, alienating close friends wouldn‚Äôt be a thing, they wouldn‚Äôt let you. Your negativity wouldn‚Äôt last and would be dominated by love.

It might be hard to envision without the right type of friends, but true friends which are like brothers or sisters that live life alongside you are available as emotional support to failsafe you from spiraling into depression.

Team sports is a regular way to facilitate the release of endorphins, serotonin and oxytocin within those relationships as well, and is an excellent reinforcer for strong bonds. That‚Äôs why I suggest it as the hobby of choice to fix depression. | Once again, I disagree whole heartedly. I believe the cure to modern depression are indeed close friendships. True friends. | [deleted] | [deleted] | Constantly been thinking about death for the past year and a half, and thinking about killing myself since I was 11. My suffering regardless of the thoughts has been fairly horrible for almost my entire life. | Suffering building character building character building character building character building character building character building character building character is fucking pointless. What good is life if you just suffer? You have zero idea.

Death is a release. | I've waited long enough, no time for pathologies anymore. 28 and I've never been loved ever. Never experienced joy or friendship or romance or been a part of society. You lived during the peak of civilization, I suffer from autism in a world where literally nobody gives a fuck about me and I've never not been lonely or felt joy. I am going to kill myself. | Not completely unsolicited if I am posting here. I guess maybe I‚Äôm looking for something I haven‚Äôt tried yet. I appreciate the comment. | I like this, thank you. | It‚Äôs not so much an external issue with other people. But more so how I feel about myself. I enjoy being alone. But not because I enjoy myself own company, I just find it way less exhausting than having to play human around other people lol | I should probably have another go at therapy. My first experience was shit as well. He had way too many patients. I saw him atleast 5 times and every time we spoke, I had to explain myself over and over like he didn‚Äôt know we had met before. (Like don‚Äôt you take notes?) 
My psychiatrist tried to throw so many pills at me, even though I kept telling him I didn‚Äôt want to have to take 3+ medications everyday and feel like a zombie. | I have felt this so many times. I am sorry you have to go through this as well | Thanks | I hear you. | It‚Äôs like fighting myself. Some days, I wake up and see how beautiful everything is. 
Then the next, I‚Äôll cry because I even woke up. | Makes sense. And I‚Äôm happy that you found something that works for you. And I hope all of the lovely people who commented and that are struggling with the same problems, still find it in them to look for that something that makes everyday worth it. 
I‚Äôm still looking for that something. | Our body works to protect us in moments like these, shutting off is a tool your body is using to keep you safe rn. People are good and they do care, but people can‚Äôt wear our strife for us. You‚Äôre numb to the world and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got so many valid reasons. Be kind to yourself, offer yourself empathy- you‚Äôre worthy of it I promise x | Saaaamee so same | Weed is what keeps me going, but I've been trying to stop due to mental health issues. I've been smoking way too much lol. It'll suck when I finally quit | Getting high as hell on weed is probably the only reason I've made it so far. It hasn't been helping as much lately, despite taking a t-break even. Music has kinda died for me too sadly. I was really into a certain band for awhile, blasting their shit helped me through being temporarily homeless, but then the depression sucked more life from me killing it, like everything else. Doesn't help that I tried showing someone I liked that band didn't get the reaction I was hoping for. | [deleted] | I‚Äôm so sorry you are feeling this way. Suicide does not help - my best friend took his own life as he endured many years of trauma. How I wish I could have helped him / you are depressed, when you are depressed your brain goes into a survival mode of sorts, a fog, your mental health declines and you may not be thinking clearly even if it feels like you are. You need rest, nourishment, and allow yourself a break despite your circumstances. It can truly help to seek professional help, you deserve to get better and you are SO YOUNG your whole world can change. 

Look up neuroplasticity, we humans have the ability to ‚Äúrewire‚Äù our brains so to speak. I thought there was no hope after man years of misfortune abuse and ptsd, but please op do not lose hope, slowly but surely you can change things for the better. Start now with one deep breath. You got this op. Who the fuck cares what anyone else thinks - you deserve happiness and you can have it. | We need to get you out of there. Is this possible | I wish we could get better parents in next life ü´Ç | How old are you? | my mom does this too, everytime I try to talk to her about my depression and suicidal thoughts she says and I quote ""If you really are suicidal you would've done it already"". 

She unfortunately knows nothing about depression and won't do any research on it. | Its literally so heartbreaking seeing others go similar situations, my mom told me we can both jump out together from the balcony laughing when i told her crying i wanted to end it. I was twelve also, i hope you and everyone else knows it is not our fault and we deserve better. | After seeing therapists give me personality disorders even after agreeing that I have severe PTSD from traumas, I lost hope. Telling the victim it's their fault, their personality's fault, their emotion's fault, drugging them into zombies so they'll stop bothering others with negative no-no emotions...


The system of ""care"" disgusts me


Psychiatry can lock someone up without a trial, tie them up, drug them, abuse them... Worse than a murderer in jail... Then be baffled why they're still depressed.¬†


Lack of b12 means the brain nerves can't renew & cause psychosis. psychiatrist never test that.¬† | [deleted] | I don't dismiss BA at all. I use extensively myself and I would be waaayyy worse off without it.


I'm just a bit pissed that when someone says ""Hey, I'm doing all this stuff, still not getting better, what are my options?"" Therapists respond with, ""hmmm, have you considered doing exactly what you're doing?"" | Thanks! And I'm glad therapy worked for you. It does for some people. | Did you read my post? The point I was trying to get at is that tons of people are doing work on themselves via various types of BA (for reference, the post in
¬†r/ therapist admitted as much about their patients) and it's still not working. But instead of being able to say ""ok let's try something else"" they just continue telling you to do the same stuff. | See, that's the funny thing. I'm having similar issues except I don't have a lot of problems with my executive disfunction, but I do want to off myself every day. So that's what my therapist is focusing on. And it's still just BA, BA, BA.¬†


Glad you're having some success though! | That's definitely part of it! I think therapists too often assume that someone's life is actually super positive and it's just the ""depression goggles"" keeping them from seeing it. Which can be the case but often isn't.


Also, this is kind of off topic, but your comment reminded me of one of Freud's ""failed"" patients, Anna O, who was diagnosed with ""hysteria"" and shut in a mental hospital for a while. Freud thought it was because she was sexually repressed and attracted to her other shrink, a Dr. B.


In actuality, the real reason she was ""hysterical"" was because she was confined to her house to care for her dying father and may have been sexually abused. Once she was allowed leave¬† the house and actually have a life of her own, her symptoms resolved! Shocking, right? | Yeah. My therapist also suggested that, I did that, nothing.


My therapist's most recent advice was to do something I enjoy for an hour every day...but I've already told her I don't really enjoy anything. So there's that¬† | What if we're depressed because we're more aware of reality than others (who get high & drink) and care nore (empathy) and got abused (traumas) by narcissists (who gaslighted us into doubting our reality so we couldn't acknowledge the abuse & flee)


And invalidating our perceptions, feelings, and demanding blind obedience was just more of the abuse that made us depressed in the first place?


And that is psychiatry. The goal is to control the slaves so they won't revolt | Those people aren‚Äôt reading your post and are just spouting the same recycled garbage as therapists do. ¬†Neither therapists or doctors understand depression nor do they have the resources to treat it. ¬†It‚Äôs easier to blame the patient instead of admitting incompetence on their part.¬† | I‚Äôm having an episode right now and I just want to end it all. I‚Äôm really tired and stressed out. But I don‚Äôt want to hurt my parents I can‚Äôt just leave them. They worked hard to give me a comfortable life. I don‚Äôt know what to do either. | I'm right there in the same boat! I think about it so much but at the same time I do want to live. | Let's talk more about lt reach out to me | [deleted] | I agree. There‚Äôs so much ugly and evil here. Why would I want to continue a bloodline of suffering. | I think a lot of people have kids. Just cuz that‚Äôs what life tells them what to do. And it makes them feel accomplished. Not cuz they really love their children. Look at Elon musk. He‚Äôs supposedly super successful here. He rejects his oldest child for being transgender. She apparently hates him and says he was never even there for her. Sounds like a shit dad to me. Not the kind of life I want. | I dono man. Seems selfish to bring kids into a world like this. I‚Äôve suffered enough for 10 lifetimes. Everyone knows their truth. I‚Äôm not invested in ‚Äúthe dream‚Äù anymore. It doesn‚Äôt add up for me. | Being a human fucking sucks. | I don‚Äôt care about physical pleasure anymore. My ex. Who I tried to marry and have kids with. Was my best friend. That‚Äôs what I miss the most. Having a best friend. Someone to go on adventures with and do life with. | And I would say yes. I would way rather be an animal than a human. 100% | I don‚Äôt wanna kill myself. I just wanna drama-free be teleported off the planet and leave forever. I hate it here. | My last girlfriend (October 23‚Äô we broke up) and I were trying to have a kid the whole time we were together. We tried to get married. Now I don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm like wtf was I thinking? This is insane. | I would never bring kids here. America is kinda fucking scary. And the world is scary as shit | I dono how this whole place isn‚Äôt gonna fall apart soon. | If they told me before I was born how bad life was going to be. I never would have came here. Ever. I will never reincarnate if they give me the choice. I will never do this all again. Ever. I hate it. | I saw your profile. It said you‚Äôre in the Uk. But if you say you‚Äôre miserable or suicidal here. They punish you. They lock you in psych wards and inject you with bad meds. You learn you‚Äôre better off saying nothing and keeping your mouth shut. It‚Äôs so fucked up. | Death doesn‚Äôt scare me at all anymore. And neither does ceasing to exist entirely. That wouldn‚Äôt even be painful. | Suicidal people are not villains. They‚Äôve had enough. They‚Äôve ‚Äútapped out‚Äù when life has put them in the endless chokehold. They aren‚Äôt the enemy. | They literally punish you, isolate you, remove your rights. And drug you up in the most negative way. It‚Äôs hell. | I just wish ‚Äúgod‚Äù, if god did exist. Would give you the option to peacefully depart. That seems like a basic fucking respect humans deserve. Who wants to live in a nightmare forever? One of the reasons I quit being suicidal is cuz I stopped trusting that god would even allow it. I started fearing I would jump off a building or something and somehow survive and be in a worse off place then when I started. I don‚Äôt even trust I could kill myself anymore. I think ‚Äúgod‚Äù would put me in a wheelchair or something and make my suffering infinitely worse. | I‚Äôve looked into suicide tourism. Going to Scandinavia or Canada to end my life. If I didn‚Äôt have a dog I adore and a mom I love. I would probably go. | Dogs are like the one nice thing on this planet. | It shifts from everyone is a piece of shit except me and everyone is a piece of shit especially me. | Hooooly shit this is 10000% facts, dude | This reply is so real honestly. Animals are awesome lmao | Yea me too fam. | Reincarnation is the definition of a fate worse then death | When my mom is upset at me because I can't function due to my depression, I tell her why the fuck did you bring me into this world anyway? Why do people have kids knowing there's a risk the life you create could be miserable? It's weird. That one egg just happened to be me? And the all the eggs of my ancestors led up to me? To exist in hell? 

Wild. It blows my mind. Just one small change in that time line and I wouldn't be here. It's so weird! | Revert to life not existing at all. Thankfully it will happen one day, but not for trillions of years. | This is what lime feels like | I‚Äôm saying I miss being dead. Humans have spent most of existence not existing. | Thankfully there‚Äôs absolutely no evidence for it at all. When we die, that‚Äôs it forever. I am glad about that, I don‚Äôt want to live again. | Because reproduction is not a logical act. It is a completely irrational instinct, even animals do it without thinking. As Schopenhauer said: 

‚ÄúIf children were brought into the world by an act of pure reason alone, would the human race continue to exist? Would not a man rather have so much sympathy with the coming generation as to spare it the burden of existence? or at any rate not take it upon himself to impose that burden upon it in cold blood.‚Äù | I don't tell my Mom that because it would kill her and she's so sweet n loving n kind. But I truly wish I wasn't the chosen egg. I ask myself this all the time. Why do people breeeeeed??? ü•∫ | Skating as in ice skating or rollerblading? | I feel similar more often these days. I just tell people I'm not an interesting person but I've really just lost interest in a lot of things in life. I don't have a lot of hobbies anymore and would rather just stay in bed all day, but I don't want other people to worry about me so I keep on pretending to be ok | [deleted] | Sorry you‚Äôre feeling the same way dude! 

Yeah ever since covid the world has just been so bleak I haven‚Äôt worked in a while or gone out anywhere I‚Äôm a shut in | I am the same way. I actually look up other people who have died by suicide. It brings me comfort knowing that I am not so alone with my thoughts. | [deleted] | [deleted] | I know the feeling and have even had two goes at it. But in those if I really wanted to be honest, I wanted the chance for it to not work. It‚Äôs a lonely place to be, but it‚Äôs not the easier option. How can I help? I want to be a supporter of you finding what you need -as I know too well, it‚Äôs not dying, cause that‚Äôs just an option amongst many others | It brings me a lot of comfort as well. I‚Äôm glad that the internet exists and I have a place where I could share my darkest thoughts without having people I know IRL being scared about me. | They really are. This is going to completely contradict what I just wrote earlier, but I feel as though my suicidal thoughts are a symptom of my mental state rather than what I truly feel deep down.

Sometimes I hope that I don‚Äôt end it too soon before I‚Äôve even tried to improve my life. I‚Äôm always at a constant state of tug of war in my own mind. | A comfort to me is reminding myself that no feeling lasts forever and that these are things we can change. We don‚Äôt have to believe everything we feel x | I've been staying alive recently and extending my days, partly due to family and also because I want to know what the universe has to offer.

Not society, the UNIVERSE. And that includes the universe within myself. | It‚Äôs hard to make sense of how society let‚Äôs people go like that and you‚Äôre absolutely right that mental health is a huge contributor. But what a wonderful display of empathy you have. It‚Äôs so important to offer understanding and compassion for others, especially when they‚Äôre disadvantaged. This is a big thought though and one that you might struggle to find a way out of as there‚Äôs no easy solution or comforting answers to hold onto. Perspective is valuable, but everyone lives their own lives. Don‚Äôt forget the joy and beauty of that too. It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the wrongdoings, but things like poverty and disadvantaged upbringing also create incredible people! The pendulum swings on both sides, so don‚Äôt forget to look at both x | If you only start running when you're close to the finish line you aren't going to win any races. | Thank you. I have been to third world countries with charity services. Many people have expressed how happy they are with their lives. A lot have even said they feel sorry for the way privileged societies live. Said they see people constantly seeking affirmation in themselves with their visits. One man said ‚Äúwhite peoples always looking for anyway to feel important- must be exhausting‚Äù and offered me a beer and said ‚Äújust enjoy the day‚Äù. We mustn‚Äôt assume everyone wants to live how we do or that there isn‚Äôt value in the lives we are led to believe are disadvantaged. Happiness can exist anywhere. Be grateful for what you‚Äôve got, don‚Äôt judge others and most importantly be kind x | A great message, thank you! It‚Äôs so hard to get it all right, but we all keep trying. The world is big and we are small - hardest balance in life is knowing when to let yourself be big or small. Work in progress x | [deleted] | [deleted] | I slept around 12 hours today. I wish I could kill myself but I can't | my top score was 23 hours | Im still sleepy tho | Pimento cheese sandwich | Not really, i have school but i stopped caring in 3rd elementary grade üíÄüíÄüíÄ | Wdym? | How | depressions a bitch | Indeed | Beeing bullied and having a learning disorder | Makes sense | [deleted] | Good question. I am now 17. I got a 9-5 job at this retail store‚Ä¶ but it is like I am there but my mind isn‚Äôt, and the day just goes by‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt even felt like I just worked my ass out. Everyday just goes by and I don‚Äôt even realize how. | [deleted] | Sounds like a lot of self imposed problems you could easily manage and make adjustments to that would eliminate nearly all of these woes, pretty much everything you listed is manageable through self advocacy | Thank you. Trying | how are they self imposed? I guess I can force myself to eat but that's about it. everything else is a result of abuse | Idk therapy and medication trials could assist with pretty much all of that but I'm not one to talk so take it as empty criticism | No you didn't almost die.  You build up tolerance to THC real quick, but if you haven't used it ever or for months, an edible will send you to Jupiter.  Take them daily then almost nothing will happen except potentially psychosis if you're prone to that. | You wanted to die..in front of your gf...who you say supposedly is amazing... Am I not understanding something? Because that's low-key rude AF. | Really don‚Äôt know the fascination of any street drug. Just hope you take it easy. | Do I eat synthetic edibles all day every day?  YES. Am I psychotic?  Perhaps.  ( In one of the few states where the good stuff is still illegal ) | I know, but there was more than just THC in the gummies. I think it had other things like ""liquid diamonds"" and a few other things but it still was horrifying. I likely wouldn't have died but it really felt like I was gone for several minutes. | Rude as in...he literally planned this out and planned to kill himself in front of his gf. Would you want your partner to do that shit to you? | When I feel like this, I just pick a comedy and lay until I fall asleep. That may help if even for a moment. | [deleted] | Wait. How do you KNOW you will be relieved? How would any of us know that? I would speculate that my cousin who was like my brother and was my best friend, I can almost promise you that his soul may not be at rest. He may not be fully relieved. He left EVERY.SINGLE.ONE.OF.US. BROKEN. There isn't a day that doesn't go by that I, my mom, my aunt (his mother) or a shit ton others of our family members do not think of him. But that's not enough. It's not enough to merely think of him. Nah, we cry, we bawlllll tears. It's been 11 years, ELEVEN YEARS and we haven't healed. We won't, we can't. We long for years that have passed. I can't stop telling my mom this phrase: ""We were supposed to get age & make fun of you and (my aunt) together..."" in attempts to make her smile. ...but how the actual f do we smile now? 

My aunt, (his mom) is a husk. She is an empty shell of what was once a human. Just like those of the Summer cicadas....a husk. 

Why should you think about anyone else right now? You shouldn't, you should think about your happiness. It isn't here, you know that. You think you know that. So far that you have experienced - you haven't found it. But I would guess that  you haven't EXHAUSTED every medicine combination, because I don't think anyone could. It takes time. It takes effort (but not that much) and a teeny, tiny, MINUSCULE amount of effort. So you start there - you start with that tiny ass piece of effort. You go forward with it and you try different talk therapists, you try different combinations (under a doctor's supervision) of medicine - because it really really matters. You take these small steps that someday kinda just mesh into a bigger step and then something larger. It's PROGRESS, not perfection. 

You're right about the gym, mostly. Why would it fill that gaping hole in your soul? It isn't supposed to, maybe. Maybe it does for some, but not all of us. And that's OK! Something else will, but you have to figure out what that is. Maybe some kind of hobby? Do you like art? I'm an artist. I'm writing all this from experience. I've been psych wards 4 times. I went to private facilities and state ran hospitals. It took THE RIGHT one. And the right one for me, was the cheaper one ran by the state and not a private practice. 

I can't tell you why to keep going, no one can. I can't tell you why to give up, and no one else can. I can only urge you to TRY because that's all any of us do every day. I'm in one of my lowest points in my life right now. I'm just reaching out to you and your post because I try to encourage others, because I appreciate it when someone tries it for me. And if you are gonna say something silly about ""no one will miss me"", or ""I would be better off..."", sorry, but no. You haven't met everyone you are to meet in your life yet, so you don't know. :) | I do not | Done this before. A psychiatric ward fucked me up even more. I'll never admit myself to a hospital | Alcohol doesn't help me. | too late man | Done both of these things. Zero point in going on | None of it is enough unfortunately. Therapy has been such a waste of time that I don't see any point in continuing. I'm gonna kill myself, I have no other choice | Have you ever considered the fact that your cousin was suffering so immensely he had no choice but to go? You say I should think about my own happiness and no one else's. If that's the case, you should think about how your cousin is no longer in pain instead of selfishly trying to preach this toxic ""suicide is selfish"" narrative that is eating you away. Think of your own happiness and care about nobody else. Like you said, nobody owes me happiness. So why should I continue living?

And nobody gives a shit about me just to let you know. I have no family who cares, no friends to speak of. | Stop normalizing suffering. 

You're pro suicide based on your toxic advice so I'm going to report you. 

Doesn't make a difference since I'm suicidal anyway LOL | I'm not gonna argue with someone who's suicidal.... everyone knows that. Excuse me, a stranger, for attempting to show you that people give a flying fuck about others. Go for it then. Is that what you wanted to hear? I didn't preach a god damn thing to you. I've been there time and again. I am absolutely sorry I wasted time reaching out to leave a comment. Do you. Go on then. üôÑ | Has not helped me | I am going to. Thank you. | Clearly, you're serious. That's why you made a post crying for attention... right. ü§£ | Nothing clears mine. Not even music. | I've done this before man. It does nothing. | [deleted] | Get your hormone levels checked. 

More and more research goes into depressions, depersonalisation and hormones and it‚Äôs really starting to come to the surface. 

I‚Äôve read a lot of people finding inner peace and happiness after finding out it‚Äôs hormone related and it‚Äôs not uncommon that it could be related. | im here if u want to talk and make some changing bro | This is my life. I'm 32M.

  
Suicide has been my go-to thought since I was 10. I woke up early while everyone was sleeping, and held a big knife to my stomach for about 15 minutes. Since then I knew that nobody, especially my parents whose job it should have been, gives a flying fuck about what I feel. And my teens were hell for me. I've had a horrible acne, and I started to despise and absolutely hate myself. And nobody gave a shit.

  
And this year I've asked for help from someone I trusted, and again I was told they don't give a fuck. I wanted one good memory, one patronus I could summon when I feel bad, to know it's fucking worth, that I'm not that ugly piece of shit. Turns out I am.

  
In my life I've attempted suicide many times, mostly trying to hang myself, like my cousin did, or my cousin's stepsister, or my great-grandpa. But I think jumping in front of a train is the way to go. I wanted to be happy, but when my happiness has to come at a cost of someone else's, what else can I do. | [deleted] | Anhedonia..are you able to explain this to me? | I‚Äôve had dark thoughts like that myself. I just don‚Äôt want to hurt those that love me, even if they don‚Äôt understand me. It‚Äôs like getting a life sentence in your own mind. | I wish there was an end in sight. Alas‚Ä¶üò• | Exactly. | Living in misery sucks marginally less than dying in it. As long as we are alive we can at least try and fight against the harshness of reality. I try to workout regularly to try and keep my spirits up. Left a pretty toxic job after 8 and a half years to try and take some time for myself to try and get into a better headspace. I know eventually I‚Äôll have to start working again, trying to figure out what I could do that wouldn‚Äôt make me so miserable and conflicted. You‚Äôre still pretty young. I wish I could back to when I was that age. I was doing a lot of stupid stuff (drinking, smoking weed, trying to deal with things) I guess I always felt kind of lost back then. And that led to bad choices. That and not having anyone that really cared I guess too. | I‚Äôve never done that before. Is it complicated getting hormone levels checked? | Thanks. Is that a yakuza reference Kasuga? | Yeah 2001 was the year hope died for me. Pok√©mon still brings me brief windows of joy. | Only a name | But can we change that? I feel like I turned to drugs for a number of years to compensate but I can‚Äôt say that actually fixed anything long term. | I don‚Äôt really have any friends myself. The family that loves me only loves me so long as I am living my life the way that they want me to. I do have one family member that genuinely does but they are out of reach to a degree due to their own life journey. | Is that safe? I‚Äôll talk to my therapist about it but do you know anything about it or someone who has? | As I said on another post, I feel the same way like the OP,  Even though I have people and family around me at home, I don't feel understood. They either don't seem to get what I'm going through or they brush aside my feelings. My phone only shows work messages ‚Äì no calls or texts from friends checking in. It's lonely, scary, and overwhelming.  I've read that medication can help, but it can take up to 4 weeks or more to work fully, and these days are crawling by and of course I also feel that my life isn't realy , Why me? this can't be happening to me. I'm very anxious and I think I would die alone. I can't concentrate on my work. I feel like if I don't post here, I'll go hours without talking to anyone and my anxiety is killing me. My work is boring and monotonous and there aren't many people around to talk to. I'm basically just sitting in an office by myself in front of a computer. | I used to think like that. I ‚Äúthrew away‚Äù a ton of opportunities. I dropped out of college, spent my savings pursuing a dream im still working at, and I have bad anxiety on top of it all. But just know that no one path in life is correct. And let that be a freedom. It sounds morbid and I don‚Äôt condone it obviously, but a reasoning that helped me out is this, you can always take your life at another time. Why not make a bold jump? For example, I hated college, mentally shut down and just couldn‚Äôt attend classes anymore. I was gonna take my life instead of telling my parents. But I decided that I could tell them, and if they kicked me out I can still do it anyways. But they were very receptive. You just never know. And at the end of the day, you are your own person, and your family just wants to see you happy and successful. If this ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù you have now is causing you this much pain, fuck it, do something that‚Äôs gonna be easier on you. It may still be hard, but it‚Äôs not gonna cause you constant stress. | [deleted] | You don't want it bro , It's just boring, monotonous, and without interaction with other people to distract you from your worries. Trust me it's killing me | That is exactly what I need is just that I haven't found one and I had to cut ties with my friends and all because they were not doing me good so I feel alone and I just don't really have the mood now to find a hobby I'm not very motivated right now to be honest. But yes you are absolutely right on | [deleted] | Same. I used to have friends but they slowly drifted away and lost touch. And I can tell from their IG that they're not too busy to hang out with other people or friends...they're just too busy to hang out with me, apparently. | [deleted] | I know the feeling | I miss it too | Yeah, I see the same thing, they hang out with each other but there must be something wrong with me | It sucks | Thanks | I'm sorry to hear that | It sucks | No one calls me | I have tried | I relate with you and op. 35f here. Anybody tryna be friends? Haha | A back burner friend. I feel this on every level. | I pestered my ""friends"" for years to go on a backpacking trip to Europe. I printed train itineraries, looked up ticket prices, studied maps, everything. They always ignored me. I found out earlier this year that they actually went...without me. Had to find out via their pictures on IG. | I'm sorry to hear that. That's terrible | Yeah, but I feel like it had to happen because it made me stop missing them or their company. I know they're for the streets now. It makes me sad and angry that I wasted so much time with them, so much time thinking they were real friends. | I came here looking for a comment like this. I‚Äôm about to test the waters with a boy who I dated last year who broke up with me due to depression. I‚Äôve been getting signals, but I‚Äôm scared it is all in my head | Welp, I got rejected, but we are staying friends still I think. I‚Äôm glad I did that, though. Now I feel I have permission to move on | I apologized and did thank her for everything and she appreciated it but I still feel bad and I still feel like I f*cked up | I know | It wasn‚Äôt she got a new bf | Pull yourself together dude, what in the fuck. Someone loves you and you don't believe them? You need to search from within and figure yourself out and come to terms with some shit or you'll end up stressing people out and dragging them down, then really end up alone. It's all in your mindset. Fix it | If you think that, then appreciate every moment with her | Poor you bro | Wdym I‚Äôm ok with what she did im just sad that i left  her when I shouldn‚Äôt have | Trust me. You are not as terrible to be around as you think you are. | I wish I never left her | I probably lost interest because of depression yep. I was too affraid to feel her how I felt in fear that she would reject me but I did a wrong move and now I lost her | Bro If she‚Äôs happy with someone else, then I‚Äôll let her be with someone else I want her happy and she clearly is rn | You think I didn‚Äôt tell her abt everything? Of course I told her | Thank you bro | Yes I did and she said I understand but I‚Äôm with someone else now so yeah | Sometimes I feel the same way. It‚Äôs the concept of nothingness and survival instincts. Usually I‚Äôm calm about death because I honestly want to die but sometimes I feel nervous about it because the unknown is intimidating 

We can‚Äôt imagine nothingness because we‚Äôll always imagine ourselves as aware of it. | Fear of the unseen | it's natural. I feel exactly the same as you | Death is the only thing guaranteed to us. Why rush it? It‚Äôs frustrating that it‚Äôs actually pretty hard to kill oneself. You have a lot working against you. But I hate commitment anyway. I don‚Äôt want to commit to being dead just yet. I would rather have a nice Xanax so my brain can stop attacking itself. And the world shape shifts into a completely different world without the constant misery juice my brain produces like McDonald‚Äôs puts out fries coloring it. Some people got nothing but shit and don‚Äôt feel bad about it. My theory is that chemicals are powerful things. Serotonin? Whose that? You feel me?

Edit: I wanna clarify. I‚Äôm not suggesting anyone do drugs. I‚Äôm only suggesting that I think a lot of whaat me and others are experiencing is chemical. Or that is what I‚Äôve come to theorize from my own drug experiments. Also doctors are cock suckers and never do anything right. Even according to their definition.¬† | Please stay, I know that‚Äôs the last thing you want to hear right now but we‚Äôre all here for you and don‚Äôt want you to hurt yourself. Do you have a therapist or are you on medications? They make a big difference. Giving you a virtual hug ü§óüíú | lmao I love that way of saying it, definitely borrowing that | [deleted] | I said I wasn‚Äôt recommending that anyone take drugs. I was more trying to imply that being depressed all the time isn‚Äôt necessarily any more real than a drug trip.¬† | Doctors are arguable as bad as cops. Both work for an oppressive system. Both hate on minorities and profile people. Both are careers that people go into for the wrong reason.¬†

Doctors mostly seem to exist to act as gate keeper to medical care that providers of it. I wish it was a discussion about my options and issues and I make the choice for my care at the end of the visit. Instead of just no. I don‚Äôt believe you. You can‚Äôt have that. Can‚Äôt rush me out of their office fast enough for my 800$ visit.¬† | Yea. I definitely believe that. What are you gonna do?¬† | I guess it was half rhetorical. What are you gonna do about depressed or whatever.¬† | For sure. You just gotta take things one day at a time.¬† I‚Äôve had fun helping people interpret their dreams on r/dreams and r/dreaminterpretation. There are a lot of dreamers but not many interpreters.¬†¬†

¬†Interesting thing about dreams is that they live in the subconscious and 90% the dreamer will say the meaning of the dream without realizing it. I just help them connect it. ¬†

¬†It‚Äôs pretty cool.¬† | What makes you feel that you are such a disappointment?


As¬† mum myself, the chances are that your parents do not feel the same way about you as you feel about yourself (assuming they are total arseholes who have made you feel this way). | It‚Äôs hard to be a good person when the people around you are toxic and treat you like a mere tool. My father expects me to improve myself but does nothing to set an example, he never has. Everyday I contemplate ending it so he can‚Äôt physically/verbally abuse me anymore, but he‚Äôll have nothing if I die. | What people? | It's because i treat them bad and I am not good in studies or anything just a failure and loser who doesn't even try | [deleted] | I get it. It sucks. Feels like it never ends. It's a horrible feeling. 

Will share what helped me through a similar period of time in case it helps you.

I got a purpose. A reason for me to be alive. What was it? I volunteered at a local animal shelter/rescue. Tough work, sad work, but it gave me some reason to be around. Only once a week but it helped me enough to get out of that mindset. 

First step? Volunteer somewhere. Even if it's 1x/wk. It's incredibly valuable work thats needed in our world. And people like you have great sense of compassion and care. It's not an overnight solution and things don't ever get easy, but it may be enough to keep on going. | Keep them close | I got a dog she definitely does put a smile on my face but she turns 8 in August so I‚Äôm not sure how long she has left | I know but it‚Äôs definitely hard to look to good future when there‚Äôs a wall of depression blocking your view | You‚Äôve described it in so much better detail. I hope you one day find your happiness I hope you keep continuing to find love for yourself untill you‚Äôve fully grasped it | I use to go on walks all the time really did make my day even if it was a little thing. But with it just being winter I‚Äôve locked myself in my house these past few months and I know that is definitely not okay for my mental health | I‚Äôve been told that I should go get therapy but to be honest I don‚Äôt even know where I‚Äôd even begin to describe anything to a therapist. I also do sometimes have those little out burst of telling myself I‚Äôm amazing asf but lately the feeling of me feeling worthy of nothing as been over powering the good thoughts so much. Also thank you so much for the hug need that | Weird enough it does make you think differently | Thank you | Keep pushing you sound like your gonna do wonderful things in this world keep in mind not a lot of people have a mindset to want to make a great impact on the world and if you do your a beautiful human being that | I‚Äôve never been close to anyone in my family besides a cousin I‚Äôve always been a black sheep | Glad you‚Äôre life changing that‚Äôs amazing | Hope you‚Äôre right | No, and it‚Äôs been going on and off for past 3 years I haven‚Äôt had one thing that stuck to make me fully happy | It‚Äôs very hard for me to actually sit and watch something on tv. I did rewatch the animated series of A.T.A.B since it‚Äôs a childhood favorite and I can‚Äôt keep rewatching it over again and anything else I can‚Äôt focus on. I also really hate my body so anytime I eat junk food I‚Äôll end up starving myself for days just because I feel so guilty | Mostly eggs, tuna, can chicken, popcorn, pancakes, ramen and macaroni but if I were to get a whole family box of Debbie snacks I could eat them all with in 2 days and then after feel shamefull of myself I use to be around 300 pounds at 15 I‚Äôm also a short guy at 5,7 I got to 175 at 18 now I‚Äôm 200 at almost 20 and I‚Äôm terrified of being that big boy again | That‚Äôs honestly really good advice I‚Äôll keep that in mind once I can fully push myself | It‚Äôs definitely hard but thank you I appreciate it | No rush whatsoever. Life's tough. Anyone that tells you otherwise is full of ****. I'm 30 now and so thankful I didn't follow through. So difficult to see ahead. I can only tell you from personal experience that things never get easy, but it gets a hell of a lot better than what you currently feel. | I‚Äôm trying thank you | I do hope you‚Äôre right | No, in my opinion, alcohol is the worst and most detrimental drug

No drugs compare to how half a bottle of whisky made me have alcohol-induced blackouts on my 21st birthday. Also, from what I can recall from other drinking occasions, tipsyness isn‚Äôt all that pleasurable; I still felt anxious and depressed underneath the buzz. Never again | It‚Äôs one of the very few things that make me actually feel good. But the afterwards feeling is not that worth it, which sucks | Yes, but there are so many ""buts"" and ""howevers"" that come with it that ultimately it's not really worth it. | Do not drink alcohol. Look up cirrhosis so you know now. I could literally be dying because I thought alcohol helped my depression. I will find out on the 30th‚Ä¶ | It can make you feel better in the short term, and a lot worse (and poorer) in the long term. Or it can make you feel worse immediately. Alcohol is a powerful depressant. Even if the first time feels amazing:

If you have depression already, DO NOT consume alcohol. The chance that it will make things worse is extremely high. | It's a natural depressant.  I would not recommend resorting to abusing substances to deal with your mental troubles.. been there,  done that... if you think your depression is a beast now... just add in addiction | As someone who is a a recovering addict, I do | Very very short lived. Do not go there my friend.  It will only make it worse. | It'll give you the illusion of feeling better. Really it just numbs you. You forget temporarily, but when you sober up whatever the depression trigger is will return. So your options become either to deal with the problem or sink into a state of permanent dissociation from the world. That's my experience with alcohol and many other substances. | Alcohol is a highly addictive substance. Do not use it as a coping mechanism. | No. Alcohol is terrible it‚Äôs bad for you and is bad for people near you.  Drunk people never make good decisions. | Please don‚Äôt fall into that trap. I went through a really rough patch at 19 and picked up the bottle. Next thing I knew, I was 35 and didn‚Äôt have shit to show for those years | Better and worse and the exact same time | Sure, in the moment. But when you sober up you feel 10x worse. | it does until it doesn‚Äôt | There is a steep diminishing return on alcohol. Believe me. I recommend talking to a professional about the way you feel, if you have not.¬†

If you are open to using a chemical to feel better, there are healthier ways that would work better than narcotics or alcohol that can be prescribed by a professional.¬† | Noooooo. Fuck alcohol. If you wanna do something smoke some weed & chill. Alcohol will make all depression 10X Worse | It makes me feel better...until it doesn't. At which point I feel much, much worse. | Nah weed is better | ‚ÄúThe only thing that can help me is chemistry‚Äù well said | [deleted] | Your logical way of writing indicates your intellect, and I assume your intellect doesn‚Äôt match w/ your peers yet. It can be isolating and frustrating at that age to go thru those things alone, esp w/ the mental goodies you have, and when few others realize their mental goodies due to unawareness of that age group. I‚Äôm in the same situation but at 22. I just have faith that slowly, things will change. I try to surprise myself often and make interesting deviations to keep life fun and to just distract. Just keep going and trusting - you‚Äôll be out of high school soon and life changes in the early 20s in a fun way. Be well please and try to find other well-spoken people like you and make them your home. Finding a family with friends takes time, but even if they‚Äôre as f‚Äôed up as you, them understanding how they‚Äôre messed up usually indicates they can understand your mess, and by extension, you. To be understood by friends helps w/ this existential pain a good deal. Having friends similar to me reminds me that others are going thru it too, so it feels a little less impossible then. Please be well and stay safe | Call it cliche but you are very young. things change even if they take years. don't lose a chance to find out if your future holds peace and good times. Sometimes it seems helpless, but it is not. when you grow older you will have more freedom and maybe less stress from your stepfather and mother. Maybe try physical activity of some kind? swimming, cycling, gym... I am not suggesting to become chiseled or something... those activities are just healthy ways to feel good and also improve physical and mental health. | [deleted] | Religion isn't answer and for someone like that person could be worst | [deleted] | Sometimes even ‚Äúbetter‚Äù isn‚Äôt enough. | forget you're suffering - or suffer in silence is really the only answer to the downtrodden - also i like blaming the fraudulent sack of shit god that is clearly a psychopathic rapist - and the rich - those are my ""things i would fucking punch the living shit out of if i could"" | I want to be content too üòå | I wish I had the money to try that idea! | That is an excellent analogy. Thank you for sharing. | watch fight club a few times - ""self improvement is masturbation"" hope there's enough of the downtrodden to start some real shit soon.  seems that's the way the media and corporate is pushing us - some sort of BUM boxing club so they can take bets on us. | I‚Äôve been on meds for years and years too, they help slightly I guess but not enough | Therapy never helped me, and I‚Äôve been on meds most of the last 15 years. Thank you so much for your kind and thoughtful response, I really do appreciate it. | I did that ‚Äúsmile through the pain‚Äù crap for over a decade and a half and now whenever I‚Äôm sad or anything I smile and I‚Äôve had more than one person ask why I was smiling at inappropriate times. It never tricked my brain into thinking I was happy it just made me look like more of a freak. | Exercise is definitely something that I could improve on | Yes of course I have. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I haven‚Äôt struggled a lot too. It‚Äôs hard to see the light when you‚Äôre in the dark. | I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs about being willing to. I really am willing to. I want it so badly. It‚Äôs not as easy as that | Therapy never worked for me. I‚Äôve been on meds most of the last 15 years and they don‚Äôt do all that much either. | I understand what you‚Äôre saying but that isn‚Äôt the reason I posted. I posted because I‚Äôm sick of having to struggle with it all. It‚Äôs exhausting being on what you refer to as a rollercoaster. I don‚Äôt wanna ride it anymore. | 30 minutes of happy compared to 6 months of depression is not a good trade off. That thirty minutes is not worth the 6 months. | I have a love-hate relationship with summer, summer nights are cool, and summer days suck, they give me massive headaches. | Yep. I live in Texas too and this heat is sulking the life out of me. | Yeah, most of reality is absolutely horrible. The natural world is just things killing other things to eat them. Humans just evolved to just exploit their prey for work and get alot more out of them than just eating their meat like how animal predators do. But morally its all the same, just a bunch of wolves and sheep out there. | [deleted] | Hey friend please please do not there is a way out of this, I'm sorry that your depressed and I know your suffering a lot it breaks my heart, I was depressed and miserable from a young age too, Jesus is there and does love you more than we can comprehend or realise and I believe he can heal you and give you life in fullness I pray that you're healed in Jesus name ‚ô•Ô∏è  I pray your still here? Please know your really loved and it will get better | Nah man this aint working keep focusing on this streetüíØ | It's from the end is where we begin. Everything can change in a moment because I know and experienced it. You can too if you put your faith in Christ and do your best to live out your faith in Christ, it is then God will reveal Himself to you and everything will be okay. This life may seem like hell but for those who put their trust in Jesus, paradise is awaiting them into eternity. No more sorrow, no more death, no more loss, no more sin, no more pain. This hope is what keeps me going cause I know that God and heaven are real because like I said He revealed Himself to me. This should help, stay up üôè | The day I realize ‚Äúheavens real and it‚Äôs where I‚Äôm going when I die.‚Äù Will be the day I take my life. Don‚Äôt anyone ever fucking offer me that easy out. Cause I‚Äôm at the point even burning in hell for the rest of eternity sounds like a blessing. | Your not just gonna burn in Hell, your gonna see the source of fulfillment and goodness and forever be separated from Him, destroying your soul too. That's gonna be your reality. Once you've been there longer than time itself your gonna still be in pain inside and out. So I advise you make a choice wisely. You don't have to do anything just believe bro. The most easiest thing to do. And you wonder why God sends us to hell cause it's the easiest thing to do¬† | Keep on going. I‚Äôve been depressed my whole life. Was terrible in school. Terrible at basically every job. Can‚Äôt read. Can‚Äôt add. I think this is a result of ADD undiagnosed. Struggled with alcoholism and nihilism most of my life. Some people just get lucky in life. A lot of mental health problems are out of our control unfortunately and it can wreak havoc on our lives. I think if I didn‚Äôt have depression/anxiety/bipolar/OCD/ADD(probably) I would have done better in school and life. My brother has no mental health issues and has been able to excel because of it. I cling to creativity. It‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got going for me. I just keep going. Keep going. | glorious wipe tie one cooperative theory rinse oatmeal hateful coherent

I think the universe wants you here, you came to exist here. You have the potential to turn things around, and I know it‚Äôs a difficult task but you‚Äôre gonna make it even know it may not be believable right now. You don‚Äôt have to die or suffer, you can realize and find what‚Äôs best for you in this time. | Remember to preserve. God got you. Ending your life will hurt those around you.
Hardships bring learning life worth living for eventually.
Keep pushing. Don't give up | Are you alive? | Please don‚Äôt do it. Think of your kids. My grandfather killed himself when all his kids were grown up and the impact was still horrific. My uncle never recovered and killed himself too. I never even met my grandfather but believe me the trauma lasts for generations. | I have no one. I haven't had anyone besides family which is very small. My kids and family were what kept me going but being away from them has been detrimental to my health. But being around my ex is just bad news. We can't stand to be around each other. Especially when she tried making a false allegations and having me thrown in jail. Thank God the judge saw through the lies in a bench trial. I should have gone to trial in my previous case but I was naive to the justice system seeing I wasn't a criminal. Now my record is tarnished I've lost many rights. I'm unemployed dude to the charges. I've become a statistic just like everyone told me my whole entire life. | I have lost everything 3 times now. I'm at the age we're Im fucked and kids don't even want to talk to me cause their mom is filling their head with poison. I have to call the school in order to talk to my son. Which he doesn't want to talk to me. Last time I saw my son he was smiling at me and said I'll see you after school dad love you. That day I left the state due to me and his mother arguing I saw if I stayed where I was living I was going to end up in jail. Sure enough she made a false allegations I had to go through a whole bench trial and was found not guilty. Now he doesn't even want to talk to me. His mom is filling his head. I receive emails from her stating she doesn't want me calling the school to talk to him because it will interrupt his education. She's trying to manipulate my children against me. But at this point I am not even caring anymore. I figured my kids would be better off with out a dad who angry he can't give them the world. I can't even buy my kids a donut if I wanted to. | You have kids though bro, think of your kids man! They NEED you! Life isn't about you once you have kids man! 

Start doing YouTube videos on the topic of this, you'll get views on views. You just need to reach 1000 subs to start getting paid. I'm at 1.65k right now and I make 130 every two months! | Wait why did you lose rights if you weren't convicted? You retain them bro, innocent until proven guilty! | Bro think about how devastated your kid would be if you killed yourself. You're his dad bro!! | Fuck man, I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through it. I know it doesn‚Äôt feel like it now, but your kids will see through it someday. The judge saw through the bs!! People will believe you! 

If you do everything in your power to push through, build the best life you can in the interim and do everything you can for them things will turn around. Those kids need you, because if your ex is doing this to you, it‚Äôs likely she will be emotionally manipulative to them. Be the best dad you can be, and if the school lets you, keep calling. Don‚Äôt even entertain it if they ask you what‚Äôs going on, don‚Äôt even disparage their mom, be the bigger person, foster their interests and ask them questions and tell them you love them. Even if you have to work a fast food job or doordash, put away even just a few dollars you can spare and set up an account for each of them. Start planning for birthdays and holidays, you can always have a family member drop them off and it will mean so much. They need you. Chances are when they get older they might even need help getting out of the situation with their mom, and if you being there is so important. It‚Äôs going to be okay, the situation must feel so overwhelming, but things do turn around. 

Life can feel like a fucking pressure cooker sometimes but just take it a day at a time. You have time to figure this out and it sucks having to wait, but this is temporary. In the meantime there are a lot of support groups I‚Äôve found online where you can talk to people who get it and it‚Äôs talked me off the ledge before. There are communities so you don‚Äôt have to feel so alone if therapy isn‚Äôt an option right now. | >I'm at 1.65k right now and I make 130 every two months!

And that is just the beginning. You will grow much more, because you are cute and necessary! | Finding something in your 30's that you can obsess through hobbies or interests with, easy distraction. | As someone with depression, stay off social media, read books instead, eat healthy and drink lots of water, try to sleep even if you oversleep, find activities that you enjoy, even if it‚Äôs watching tv or playing a video game, exercise, socializing with people at least twice a week. | hey if you wanna talk you can talk, you can take help from your friend, or from a doctor | Great advice, thank you so much! | 
YOU ARE NOT A LOSER brother! You‚Äôre going through a lot and doing it by yourself you‚Äôre immensely strong, focus on what you want, what about linking a job with a hobby or an interest ? Are you creative? Are you compassionate? Are you analytical? Match your personality with a career and hopefully it won‚Äôt even feel like work!

u/AcrobaticDiscount272,725,"I've been depressed my entire life. They lied. Getting older doesn't make it better. I've never been completely happy . From the time of consciousness, I've never been happy. As a matter of fact I've always been sad. Internally lonely. Delusioned. No mental peace. 

Each year as I got older, my depression would reach certain heights. Get more extreme. 

Around 19 years old, one morning, I woke up and decided I wanted to die. I chugged bunches of sleeping pills and some liquor I found in the kitchen cabinet. I then went back to sleep. I would've succeeded, honestly. My grandma and mom came back from the grocery store . My grandma had somehow made it into my room and accosted me into the bathroom tub . Threw me into some cold water. 

I threw up a bunch. That was the second time I had committed suicide. 

I'm 25 and it's not better. I have moments where I burst in tears. I also realized I'm truly alone. When you're a teenager, you attend school by force. You get to still have some interaction amongst people. Though when you get older, its not like that at all. You can go days and months without speaking to anyone and anyone speaking to you. People can ignore you. Not read your text. People can reject you. As you get older. So reaching out for help can absolutely be useless.

How can someone spend their entire life trying to convince themselves that they should keep living ? How do you convince someone of such a thing and continue to do it over and over and over again.

u/AffectionateTwo3946,98,"Survived suicide only to be body shamed by my partner  I am a cis woman and I was dating a cisman at that time. After I survived I was home for several days, leaving only to go meet my psychiatrist. After a couple of weeks I decided to go to a small event near our home where people were selling small handmade goodies. I figured it was a low stake engagement with the outside world that would cheer me up. I went there with my then boyfriend and we got back home after 15 mins of being there. I bought a couple of candles and a some hair and skin masks from a very sweet young woman.

When we got back home my boyfriend told me he was embarrassed that I had not shaved my face and that as it is he is on the edge because of of my attempt and that he doesn't need the additional attention on him because he is accompanying a woman with facial hair. I was 29 at this point and have had really dark and thick facial hair all my life. When I was 16 yes old I got laser treatment for hair removal and it helped reduce the growth. I have always been very self conscious about my facial hair and in some ways I was enjoying not giving a crap about these superficial things since I was feeling better in days. 

At that point I felt bad for him, apologised and told him I'll be more mindful about my grooming habits. But now, years later, I wish I could go back to my younger self, give her a hug and tell her that her way of experiencing and expressing joy is valid. ",u/AffectionateTwo3946,3,"Thank you so much for this! I live in a country where facial hair is very common for women and also culturally ignored if not accepted.

I have also laid this out as kind of a revenge to the person i love, who only treats me like shit.

We‚Äôve never been together, but we saw each other sometimes every month. He celebrated my birthday with me last July 10th. He didn‚Äôt with me when it was his last 15th. But he saw my message to him.

When I tried to give him an advice because the last time he laughed about my previous slight accident, he said that I should not tell him how to act. Then I knew that after all the things I did for him, I didn‚Äôt matter to him.

As of this time, he still hasn‚Äôt seen my message to him about sorry I am when I said that he should refrain from laughing at someone else‚Äôs condition.

Of course, he is not the only reason why I‚Äôm doing this. I have been failing lately at my work. I can only do some mediocre work. I don‚Äôt do that much meaningful stuff. I am also exhausted.

I know that when I do this, I would fail my family especially my brother. But I just couldn‚Äôt keep living anymore.

Had I been more experienced I‚Äôd be dead / but living out of spite is still living. I definitely was amazed I managed to mess up shooting myself. Seemed simpler in my head | Thank you | I am glad you found reasons to stay. Thanks for sharing | Hey thanks for replying. Personally I think it‚Äôs because I had to move home, and I‚Äôm seeing all of my friends (and not friends just people I went to school with) succeed, flourish, find partners, having children, buying homes. 
My best friend is moving to Spain. I am not particularly attractive. I‚Äôm trying to lose weight, but I see how the world opens up to women who are attractive. My best friend‚Äôs life, is so easy. People are actually kind to her. 
She doesn‚Äôt understand that that isn‚Äôt normal. I often wonder how different it would‚Äôve been. Had I been beautiful. Or not mentally ill. Probably fine. I‚Äôve felt like an imposter most of my life. I was living and working in NYC, but I couldn‚Äôt stand it. I tried to kill myself there as well. But pills don‚Äôt work. Hence part of the reason I moved back home / quit my job, was to get a gun. 
Anyways. I hear what you‚Äôre saying. I think if I didn‚Äôt have to hear about anyone else‚Äôs life; and I was completely up to my own standard, living in the woods, I‚Äôd be fine. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm built for the way society is now. And society certainly doesn‚Äôt want me | Thank you for this response. I know that this is the correct answer. I think I just want to have a vision for the future and that is really hard at the moment. Usually the future vision helps me fight for myself. I have to just get UP and become a literal gym rat. I know this is the way. Thanks for responding. | Wow thank you. This means a lot to me. I don‚Äôt often hear people tell me I‚Äôm articulate, or emotionally intelligent for that matter. I‚Äôm currently trying to get clearances to volunteer at a woman‚Äôs shelter. I hope at the least I can help others, even from this place. That is a path I could se forward. I deeply appreciate this comment. I will keep the AA saying in mind | I am sorry you relate to this post. Truly. If I could have a camper van and be unbothered by society I would‚Äôve done it by now. Also- my therapist did suggest PMDD a couple times, but I got my hormones tested and they were thinking normal range. Maybe there isn‚Äôt a test for it? I don‚Äôt know the depths of PMDD. So I‚Äôm sure it could be worsened by it. I just wouldn‚Äôt know what to do about it | That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do. Its crazy how much putting my feet in the grass or feeling the sun on my face can do | Thank you. I really resonated with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give up on your life on a low.‚Äù I think half the time all I want is to be seen, like you said. I am extremely grateful for everyone that has replied here. I have screenshotted a lot of these just to remind myself. I know you‚Äôre all strangers but I know others have been in my shoes. You definitely did not upset me. Do not worry, quite the opposite. Thank you | What‚Äôs funny is yes, wayyyy before. I was hospitalized around 2019 (for like a week). I do not recommend it. Definitely makes it worse. It‚Äôs more to get you on meds and charge you money, and I say that not out of spite, but as an observation. Also? I don‚Äôt know how that didn‚Äôt show up when I bought the gun. I guess I‚Äôm grateful because that would‚Äôve been embarassing | Thank you both for replying as well. Right now I feel my siblings / friends would be better off without a sister who is constantly bringing them down. I hear you and am glad you both found reasons to stay. I do not find appeal in ‚Äúliving out of spite‚Äù (not that that‚Äôs what you said, I‚Äôve just heard that before)
I am trying to keep going; but right now I really see a future where I end my life. I am sorry to say. Thank you however. Any show recommendations? | It‚Äôs okay I totally get it. Thanks for responding- I‚Äôll keep watch for the zombies ü´° | All I have is my dad. My siblings have their own lives. / boyfriends and such. My dad is kind of a hermit but he has a good heart. And I totally agree with you. But what they do have is external factors for success that signal how others should treat them. (Looks, significant other, friends, house, good job, cool place to live, ETC.) I think I would be fine if those did not exist. Plus my friend, while she has her struggles, life literally throws opportunities at her. I wish I was joking. I don‚Äôt want her to realize I‚Äôm a loser and slowly cut me off. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm afraid of. My friends I do have, slowly realizing I‚Äôm a loser. And one by one stop talking to me. They‚Äôre all I have right now | I appreciate that! But I fear I wouldn‚Äôt be a good one. I keep eating cause it feels like my only companion sometimes. But I wish you luck! You can do this | I think you are projecting your personal situation onto mine- which is normal. I am only speaking to my experience.

I read this fully and I hear what you are saying. However- I promise I am not ‚Äújudging‚Äù her. We talk almost everyday. I would more so say I ‚Äúassessed‚Äù the situation. She tells me the things that come to her and you would be amazed. In no way do I think she‚Äôs not a hard worker, or deserving of things. It just feels like we are in different categories of society. 

The thing that I think shattered me a bit, is realizing people will never give me the same opportunities, chances, or kindness. I had to stop going out together because it was too painful.

While I certainly agree that people will assume pretty people did not ‚Äúwork‚Äù for things, I think that is much better than the alternative of never receiving opportunities in the first place. I do believe to a certain extent those who fit this category do not see how kind people treat them in comparison. 

I know my friend inside and out, and have seen all of her trials and tribulations. She is a fighter, and an amazing person at that. However, life offers her a hand to get up every time, largely due to her appearance. That is unfortunately the way it is. 

I agree with your last paragraph. I do not want to do this to my dad. He does not deserve this burden on his shoulders. It is something that I do not take lightly by any means.

In conclusion, I don‚Äôt think anyone should ‚Äúassume‚Äù a persons LIFE is easy due to their appearance. Thats not what I‚Äôm saying. However, in my situation, I have noticed time and time again, strangers, coworkers, ETC; will be kinder, more sympathetic, and treat you with more respect if you are beautiful. This is a psychological fact. I‚Äôve just seen it play out unfortunately. I don‚Äôt know if I can continue playing this game. 

My friend is an incredible person and I want the WORLD for her. However it‚Äôs hard when she  does not see how her situation is not comparable to mine. She sees me as beautiful, because SHE is a beautiful person (on the inside AS MUCH as the outside). Unfortunately the world, is ugly. We are friends because we are very similar in our mindset, our attitudes, and our kindness. However the world sees us differently and treats us differently largely for that fact. | I haven‚Äôt! I will try this out- it can‚Äôt hurt. Thanks! | I hear you. I love my siblings with all my heart and want to see them succeed. The thought of them pitying me however, is something I cannot handle. I would have loved to be an older sister they could take pride in, not one that ‚Äúlives with dad‚Äù in her late 20s. I do not want our relationship to become one where I just never get better. I cannot keep relying on them to keep me alive. It is ultimately up to me.
I think if I killed myself, they would eventually get over me. That is the way of life. Selfish I know. But it‚Äôs better than me continuing to be mentally ill, until they are ashamed of me and ultimately distance themselves. I don‚Äôt want the only time I see them to be on a Christmas card. While I rot in an apartment, alone with my cat. I simply cannot allow that to happen. 
If there was an option for me to die by someone else‚Äôs hand, that would be absolutely ideal. Then they could take their feelings out on someone else, and have a positive memory of me. Sorry for the ramble. I understand your position but I feel very strongly about my own | I guess my response to this is what‚Äôs the alternative? Live life long enough for them to cut me off?

I've been feeling really depressed at my lack of friends and I just don't know what I'm supposed to be doing differently.  
I had friends in college, but many of them moved away, or just stopped inviting me to things after graduating. The only time those friends ever reach out to me is when they need help getting a job or something. I have a closer knit group that I hang out with now of 3 other guys (2 who I live with), but I haven't been happy in that circle. I feel like I'm the least liked friend in that group and I find myself having to change my personality because I know my authentic self wouldn't be accepted by them. These are the only friends I have.  
I feel like they never have shown much appreciation for me as long as I've known them. I went to Japan and bought them souvenirs to show them that they mattered to me even abroad. But those same friends barely even asked about my trip or cared to hear any of my stories. In fact, I spent more time hearing what they did altogether over the weekends I missed being abroad.  
It just feels like no one in this world will ever see the value in me. And I'm starting to wonder if it's because I don't have value to offer.

u/Background_Poem2037,252,"I feel like my suicide is justifiable. I have 7 days left until I kill myself. 16M. Apologies for the long read. My life sucks. Always has. I'm an incredibly short skinny ugly boy. I hate the way I look, and how I talk because I'm socially inept and awkward. I hate the generation we live in. I'm so hideous that I've been called ""failed abortion"" my whole life. I'm really stupid too, like really really stupid. However, others get the impression that I'm ""smart"" because I look like a nerd. I'm not. My entire life has been upside down, I've always thought about suicide even from a young age. I remember being so lonely and alone in kindergarten and I promised myself I would kill myself when I reached fifth grade. I didn't. I carried on. ""things will get better"" I said. I kept saying that to myself and look where I ended up. I've been bullied both physically and mentally for a good portion of my life for reasons I couldn't control, (example my weight, height and face). Everything I seem to do I mess up. I really feel like the most unlucky person there is in the world, I always screw things up. I get horrible grades even though I work really hard.  I stay up every night reviewing shit but nothing works.  It's infuriating when I put in all this work and random drug addicts don't even try in school and get way better marks than me. I'm an academic failure. I tried tutors, but they can't help me with the exams. Why is my dream job locked behind good grades? I just want to help people, help those who cannot help themselves like me. I don't want to give up on that dream but my marks say otherwise. Why does school have to be so hard? It's my final year in highschool and my marks are absolute shit, I don't understand anything and no one is willing to help. I try my best in sports but I suck at every single of them, I'm a really skinny toothpick-built guy and I have no strength. I looked and attempted to find something I was good at, but no, it doesn't exist. I used to have hobbies until I realized I was always the one who came in last place. I tried improving my physique. I've been going to the gym every single day for the past 6 months and yet I feel no difference. Either that or progress is really slow. I can't take creatine or any protein shakes because it really messes up my stomach. I'm cancelling my membership next month because I will probably be dead by then. I have really bad stomach issues. The pain is unbearable. I've been going to so many different doctors and all of their ""methods"" aren't working for me; nothing seems to work. I've been trying to hold in my emotions but after a certain point I just exploded which was my biggest mistake yet. I told my family doctor how I really felt and he diagnosed me with severe depression, anxiety, and OCD. My parents got really mad at me, telling me I'm being ungrateful and that there's ""nothing to be sad about"". I hate that so much. Ever since then they hated me too, thinking that I'm trying to get them arrested or something but all I really need is some help.   I was prescribed medication for my illnesses but they didn't even last a week in my household. I threw them out due to the constant slander; my parents would think I would get addicted. My sister hates me with all her gut. She has no more love left in her for me. She's very ageist against teens and thinks I'm being a typical teenager but I've felt depressed for a long time. I can't remember when I last experienced real emotion. I feel cold all the time even though my body temperature is normal. My mother is really scary. She always thinks the worst of me and threatens to self harm herself in front of me. I understand her pain though, but she never understands me. My dad was recently diagnosed with cancer, my younger brother passed away recently too. I have other really unfortunate events that happened in my family but I can't list them all here. I should feel sad but I can't. I feel like I reached maximum sadness. I feel guilty that I'm not sad but everything hurts so much. I have no friends, at least genuine ones. I've been used all my life for other people's benefits. I never had a friend who stuck around with me for a long time. Not only that but I was put in this ""academic school"" for ""gifted people"" in elementary. It's just a lie. My childhood friends were all suicidal and had abusive alcoholic parents. I'm at least grateful I didn't go through the abusive parent part. At the same time, as a result of this, many of them have resorted to self harm, drinking, smoking/vaping. I have never done any of those except for self harm. I don't know what I did to deserve this, all I ever wanted in life is to be normal, to be at least good at something and enjoy it. Instead I got the opposite. I've been holding on to live for so long but I finally settled on suicide. My university application is in 7 days and if I don't get accepted I think I'm going to end it all.  I really want a painless way to go. I'm a pussy, that's why. I thought about overdosing on pills but that has a low success rate. I can't hang myself because I'm too weak to tie a noose. I can't jump off a building because I'm afraid I will survive the height. Please, someone help me get out of this nightmarish hell. I don't know what I did to deserve this. I tried making changes, I told myself at the lowest point you can only go up. I can't. I'm still down here. I really want a gun to my head, everything hurts, I'm tired and exhausted and I've been pushing myself. Sorry for the long read. No one will read this anyways because it's too long. Someone help me, please. If I get rejected from my university I think I will really kill myself.",u/Background_Poem2037,55,"Thanks, man.

I have a great family and a wonderful set of friends but I feel like it's holding me hostage. I want to die the idea of being unshackled from this world to me feels like the ultimate form of freedom.

u/BoringLoverrr,116,"How do people with chronic depression manage to date?   I‚Äôd like to get some insights and advice from people who‚Äôve been struggling with depression for the majority of their lives. How do you take that first step into the dating world without feeling like you have to hide it so that the other person won‚Äôt leave you once they see you for who you really are? I imagine having a strong circle of friends and family helps but unfortunately not everyone has that. Also it feels like modern dating is all about looking for a reason to eliminate someone based on their perceived shortcomings, and I find dating as a man is already difficult enough as it is without having a mental illness. I‚Äôm at a loss here and I can‚Äôt shake this impending sense of doom. Anything will help. I feel stuck and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the world anymore. ",u/BoringLoverrr,10,"I hear your man and I know that feeling of feeling like you‚Äôre missing something all too well. I‚Äôm actually experiencing that feeling right now in this very moment. You can‚Äôt help but think something happened or rather something didn‚Äôt happen to you when you were younger and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre fucked up. 

I know it feels like our ‚Äúlogic‚Äù is air-tight but we really have to fight to convince ourselves that it‚Äôs a lie that our brains have spun. Not everything that will happen to you has happened yet is what I tell myself even though it gets drowned out by all the other things in our head. 

Feel free to dm me if you want to talk more | Thank you for this comment. I do get overwhelmed easily when it comes to dating, probably because I have a strong craving for being loved so I automatically ‚Äúdream‚Äù about ‚Äúbeing loved by this person‚Äù even though I‚Äôve gotten really good at suppressing that train of thought. But the problem is that the craving is still there so what I end up doing to combat this is to tell myself that I need to ‚Äúearn‚Äù that other person‚Äôs love, which isn‚Äôt a necessary a bad way of looking at romantic relationships. Some might even say that makes perfect senses given our innate biology: we need to prove ourselves a suitable mate to whoever we‚Äôre trying to court. But in my opinion this can present a problem to people like myself, who for whatever reason seems to require more adoration or validation from others in order to feel ‚Äúwhole‚Äù. We feel this pain within ourselves and to make sense of it we tell ourselves that love is, unlike what people like to say, solely conditional and we just haven‚Äôt gotten to that point that others have gotten to yet-because we‚Äôre not enough. And this could very well has something to with our economic system where we‚Äôre constantly pressured to ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù. Sure, it makes for excellent fuel for engines of industries but does it incur a psychological cost in the process? But I digress. 

I guess the best course of action that people commonly tout is to love yourself but it‚Äôs incredibly difficult when we‚Äôre social creatures by nature and constantly look to others to form a picture of our identity. No one is an island as they say. 

If someone could give advice on how to love yourself, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it because I don‚Äôt know if just repeating a mantra to yourself every morning does it for me. | Holy shit, are you me!????? 
My longest relationship was 4 months and we weren‚Äôt even really boyfriend and girlfriend lol

You are a fucking badass for still powering on. I‚Äôve put all my dating apps on pause lol 

I went to a couple meetups earlier this year and I had fun and made like one female friend (I really need more female friends lol). But I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôm finding myself in an episode right now, probably been going on for almost a month, before that it was more low-grade. I‚Äôve spent more time talking to people online, probably not a good thing but I just don‚Äôt want to deal with anyone in ‚Äúthe real world‚Äù right now. 

Yeah it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôm seriously thinking about getting on medications and into therapy again. That‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs bad lol 
Dysthymia doesn‚Äôt really feel that serious when you‚Äôre in it but this feels like a different beast. Anyway, I hope I have the strength to make an appointment with a provider tomorrow, easier said than done given how good I‚Äôve gotten at delaying help and numbing myself to the point that I rarely do any kind of introspection anymore, which is usually how you know you have a problem.

How long have you been depressed for?Have you been making any progress? | Well unfortunately I have anhedonia/emotional numbness.Cause damn I wish I would just be angry and push those weights till I crumble while thinking about how unfair and shitty it is that I have depression.Instead I just feel emptiness.. | It‚Äôs fine bro..it‚Äôs hard for everyone of us to some extent.I‚Äôm anxious asf in the gym as well,cause I don‚Äôt wanna ‚Äúlook stupid‚Äù in front of others‚Ä¶and I hate when the gym is full but I never have time to arrive early in the day ://.
I still go cause I wanna stick to my goal.But it‚Äôs completely fine to not feel like it,you‚Äôre depressed after all and it‚Äôs not your fault. | Damn sorry..For me it‚Äôs been 5 years and only last summer I started medication and therapy.Might give ECT a shot too if things aren‚Äôt working.
Yes I am completely numb, although I still get like sort of a rational anxiety instead of an emotional one if that makes sense.Like I‚Äôm scared deep inside and I am concious of awkward moments but it doesn‚Äôt awaken emotions in me.
Problem with me is that my real personality,before I started to be depressed,is that I love being around people and socializing.So now that I‚Äôm not good at it anymore I isolate myself and criticize every interaction I have if it‚Äôs not good/interesting enough.

My (25F) brother (29M) is extremely obese (roughly 350-400lbs), recently lost his *part-time* job (after being fired over and over again from other jobs), doesn‚Äôt hang out with his friends, plays video games all day, doesn‚Äôt have a girlfriend, has untreated sleep apnea, and still lives with our mom. My mom has cried to me that she‚Äôs terrified she‚Äôs going to try to wake him up one day and he won‚Äôt wake up and I simply cannot imagine losing a sibling since they‚Äôre the reason I didn‚Äôt end my life multiple times. 

We have tried to talk to him about his weight, where he‚Äôs going in life, and have tried to get him to do fun things with the family but he fights us tooth and nail and gets extremely upset and frustrated. Since losing his job, he also lost his health insurance, but that doesn‚Äôt really matter since he won‚Äôt go to the doctor anyway. 

He‚Äôs interested in technology, game development, and gaming in general. He thinks he wants to go back to school, but I don‚Äôt see any motivation in him. It‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs depressed, something he‚Äôs struggled with his entire life, but it‚Äôs slowly killing him and I just can‚Äôt watch it anymore. 

My plan is to find him resources on weight loss and various career paths with flyers, as well as some resources for his mental health. I can lead a horse to water, but I can‚Äôt make him drink it, you know? What are my options here for motivating him? (In the past, he‚Äôs always been motivated by his girlfriends, but he doesn‚Äôt even put himself out there to find anyone.) I know he needs to get his own place, but he really needs to establish some work ethic to even do so. Any advice is greatly, greatly appreciated.

He also has 4 cats and 5 dogs in the home hahaha he loves animals | He really started to struggle with his weight after a terrible break up with a long-term gf and graduating high school. Childhood was very, very messy.

There are definitely traumas there as my mom was also a single teen mom when she had him (15 years old). He also jumped around a lot from home to home, lived with his aunt and uncle for a while my mom was homeless. He seemed to be his best self in high school and maybe 3 or so years after. Then a lot of his friends started dying (overdoses, car accidents) so he has maybe 2 friends he still occasionally talks to. He had a few relationships, but they all ended up cheating on him.

My (28m) partner (27f) just left me after five years and i can feel myself falling into a deep depression. I will spare the greater deatils but things have been so incredibly difficult for me the past two months and i feel completely traumatized. Nothing feels important. nothing feels worth it. And i am fighting back panic attacks 24/7. I have a lot of friends and a lot of distractions but it all feels so hollow without her in my life. I am not doing good at all. I have started seeing a therapist.

With all this going on i have somehow started masturbating way more than i ever have before. Multiple times a day, surpassing what was a normal amount before. Every time i do im just thinking about how much I miss being with her and longing for what I had just a few months prior. its a cycle of having my mind race, thinking about her, thinking about the physical times we had together, the times we could be having right now, missing those times, getting horny, masturbating, thinking of her, relieving myself, then sitting there realizing i am a complete emotional disaster right now. Has anyone else experienced this? This increase in sexual thoughts and desires while going through depression? I cant seem to shake it.

If you can't find or muster the non-existent energy, people will watch you rot and die. None will go out of their way to help you.

To treat your depression, you need to be active, socialize, eat properly, journal, go to therapy, exercise, and constantly battle to get proper help from somebody who even half gives a shit.

I had to have an oblation to sever some of the scar tissue that was making my heart beat improperly. any unnecessary strain I put on my body makes the scar tissue grow more so I had to quit my dream job as an arborist and started my own company. we made an agreement that since this was the case she couldnt quit her job or do anything that would jeopardize her position unless she could get all of her credit cards paid off and already had another job lined up. 4 days after i made the transition to running my own company she went on loa for no good reason and dove head first into a bottle. she hasnt paid any of her cards off so I have been paying close to 5k a month in interest absolutely negating any money I was making (she thinks by paying that interest every month that she is building credit) on top of that she has pulled out several loans that I am now responsible for paying by default. she has spent every dime that I had put back to pay my taxes so now the IRS is coming after me. she has refused to find a new job and cant go back to her other one but they wont technically fire her (they want her to resign so they dont have to pay unemployment) i need another operation or im going to die but I cant get it because our health system in the US wont deal with me without the insurance I used to have through her work.

It seems like no matter which way I turn I'm screwed from every direction | That's what I thought too, apparently since we're married she doesn't need my consent plus on our personal account I was added to it so she has full power to do whatever she wants with it | Nope just 2 cats, 2 dogs and a raccoon | Shit you mean them? No | Yes but they literally laughed at me and told me next time I should duck and dodge. The whole left side of my face was swollen and bruised, they don't care about domestic violence unless it's the woman that gets harmed. | Oh I've made it extremely clear that I want one and she just threatens to self terminate if I do | The sad thing is when we met she wasn't like this, I decided to marry her after I broke my back. If it had been anyone else they would have kicked me to the curb in my wheelchair, when we got married I was covered under her work insurance and got my back fixed. Then I went back to work making around 325 a day, she started getting too used to that and started wasting money and drinking after our 1 year anniversary then turned it into a serious problem/lifestyle. I explained to her years ago that she couldn't continue like that if she wants us to have a future and we'll I guess she didn't believe me. 

She's so damn lazy I doubt she'd even do that, I'm just ready to have her out of my life or to get straightened out for once. | Thank you I'll look into that.

I reported her missing after she got drunk AF and went missing for over a day and they put me in handcuffs to interrogate me over her murder. Then she stumbled out of our shed drunk as fuck asking why the cops were there and they let me go without a single apology. | Oh I told them and they told me that they have to see valid proof of her threatening it. I started recording everything since then but she hasnt had a really bad black out session since. | I understand this more than I'd like to, I have chronic depressive disorder and it has driven me to alcoholism in the past. Luckily I have the strong will to bring myself out of it but even then alcohol makes me happy and gives me the opportunity to reflect on the things I have to be happy about. 

I don't like to argue and keep almost every situation as low key as possible. I don't respond well and shut down even when being yelled at so I choose not to go that route. I'm at the point where I have described the situation and what it entails so many times and different ways that I've come to the conclusion that either she doesn't understand or doesn't care. 

You can only explain that a box is square because it has 4 sides with 4 90¬∞ angles so many times before you come to the conclusion that the person wants to believe that a circle is a square so firmly that the facts don't apply. At that point you are wasting effort and energy since factual evidence means nothing to the person who you wish to perceive the message

Personal growth takes effort and it's required to keep ties with your surroundings including the people you want to keep around. I've never read the book you mentioned but I hope I hit somewhere close to the point of it, I'm hypercritical of my own words/actions and how they are perceived by others. | Especially here, they tell me regularly that it's easier to zip up a body bag than to do the paperwork for arrests/crimes even the detectives don't do shit and usually get put on paid leave for selling the drugs that they stole from dealers | She refuses to go to AA, I even tried to get her to go to the hospital to detox and she refused that too. | I learned the ways of dealing with it from my experience with my dad who drank himself to death and she gets extremely aggressive with me when I make the point that she wants to drink and doesn't have to. Anything else is just an excuse, honestly I'm tired of getting hit over it. I told her that when we lose our home we are going in different directions. I'm going back into the woods like when I was a teen and she can go wherever someone will take her.

I was at work and had tried to call him many times. We have location tracker and I noticed he was at home which was unusual. I got this bitter feeling and decided to go home early. The commute is about an hour and I could not shake the feeling. When I got home I found he was locked in the bathroom. I knocked and called his name and heard him grunt from inside I started to become frantic hitting the door until finally he opened it. He was drunk, he had a wound on his head, there were knives, alcohol, and pills on the floor. He was not speaking clearly but talking about how he couldn't live anymore. I can't really repeat everything without crying. I called an ambulance and they took him to the hospital. He has been hospitalized since. We live in Europe in a country where I don't speak the language fluently. Calling emergency services, finding the hospital, and even where he was was so difficult. But our healthcare is covered. I cannot sleep in our room, I work from home and somehow I am managing. I visit him everyday and see the man I love a shell of his former self. We have been together for over a decade. We are still young. I just did not see this coming and I am terrified. I don't know what to expect. I myself have anxiety and I feel like the adrenaline and shock is what is keeping me going. I keep praying for him to come home but I don't know when he will be able to. I am eternally grateful he is still here and I am so scared. I dont know anybody here, he is my everything.

No family, failed to start one.

Hobbies only help to pass time, not to make it meaningful. And trust me, I tried lots, and for a long time. 

Never found any meaning in all 20+ paid jobs I had, only a paycheck.

Volunteerings, same, still do but it never brought me satisfaction and happiness. When I'll stop, nobody even notices anyway.

Didn't find solution in religion either.

By now I mostly think that I'm just not suited for living, and mostly just hoping to due sooner. Such a waste ü§¢",u/Duke_Nicetius,36,"Thank you.

It doesn't bother me much but it would be an exaggeration to say that now it's all fine.

As for meaning and small things - I see it differently, for me small things always were just a small nice factor of spending some time till going to sleep, and in last years they became mostly not interesting at all for me. | For me present doesn't have anything good, so it feels even more depressing without meaning | I'm sorry, it must be tough.

I hope you'll find the way to improve the situation. | Good question, maybe. | I'm not sure it's really useful ‚òπÔ∏è especially compared to what some governments do to destroy everything good. | I was hoping that I won't live even as long as I did now, but somehow I'm still alive. Would definitely be easier to die sooner. | Thank you! Thanks for helping here.

Life really seems unbearable. | Yes, I understand what you mean. Feeling a lot like this. | I never wanted to have a pet... | And where is the meaning of life? | My life was hard, not well. Also poor and lonely.

I tried therapy but it never helped. Now have no money for this. | I'm very sorry ‚òπÔ∏è
At least puzzles... though personally I never was a big fan of them. | I did travel but it became borign pretty fast; nowadays I'm not missing it at all.

I tried therapy in the past, and it never helped. Now don't have money for this. | I appreciate your opinion but as it's said in my country ""good man is not a career"" | What for? I traveled a lot, Niagara to Galilee, no meaning in this. | I don't have much to sell, not even a car | Yea, plenty of things if we talk about very short term emotions. I think I'm pretty empathic overall, can catch the emotions around easily. | Just wonder, how do you manage to get viewers? I had a channel about history but all videos got less than 100 views in a year. | I did in the past but traveling became boring fast, and I don't miss it. | Lol üòÅ  i don't really know what to answer on this idea | I explored many | My life is not good without any comparison ‚òπÔ∏è

By now I completely lack those, and always lacked. It sucks.

Thank you, I hope I'll somehow find something, even though it's less and less hope.

And anyway, in the past I traveled a lot. | Vice president of cultural nonprofit, soup kitchen and homeless cats.

Probably because there is no meaning. | No interest in this. | It seems there's nothing good in the future. I mostly just wait to die. Unfortunately I'm too healthy, and regularly hanging out in dangerous places didn't help and only made locals accustomed to me. | Yeah, wish we could find those people | I like history researching, sword fencing, shooting, photography, wood carving, writing... did or do it all. | I did. | I did, like I was a volunteer tutor for students with learning disabilities. Same.

I didn't have that particular suffering other than having to leave the country not to take part in its unjust war. | I did but as you can see it never worked out. Life sucks. | That's nice. I did try new things, improve in old hobbies but year after year i see that it leads me nowhere, it became just a nice way to pass time before going to bed | Asked out hundreds girls, studied a lot. | Meaning for me is seeing that it really makes the world around better.

And no, I didn't feel so. | I dunno, I'm in Italy and it's not better here. Same life problems. | I can't see motivation in those, because I see no real meaning. As if we don't have enough tradesmen or photographers. | I did it too of course.

Now though it seems anyone my age is in relationships or married (Russia and Italy, two my countries). | Too much responsability for a single person without securiry network (long story) | There are here teachers for all those things though.

It seems we have too much of everything nowadays.

I didn't completely understand what do you mean | Yeah, life is hard.

I felt that my small work won't change that system most likely will screw them anyway.

It's very demotivating, to see how big systems can easily destroy any results of small work. | Right here there are none but mostly for legal things, italy is overly bureaucratic | In many cases more personal approach is hardly possible (including legal regulations), and resources are usually even more scarce than in ngos who at least can fundraise. And depending on the fired, might be as well prone to be destroyed by big guys.

Don't think I'm a naysayer, just saw it too much in my life. You can't imagine how much of this field was destroyed back in russia since the beginning of the war.

I used to get super hooked on shows like Twin Peaks or Game of Thrones. I used to love playing video games, I‚Äôd spend hours and hours playing Skyrim or Zelda.

Now, nothing holds my attention. It‚Äôs like my brain refuses to produce endorphins because f*ck me I guess.

u/Emotional-Vacation39,176,"My friend killed himself and Idk how to carry on anymore 

It's tough typing this out, almost 4am, I've lost my best friend, and I'm at a loss myself. We were both immigrants here in Europe, left our home country for what we hoped would be a better life. But, honestly, it's been anything but.

We faced racism here more than we ever expected. People have racism ingrained in them, we were truly alone in sense that no other friends, the locals looked down upon us and how we were told these people are civilized, looking for apartment or any place of accommodation as a person of color is a nightmare, we had people reject to our face despite having proper documentation and funds. Women are also so shallow, somehow they are okay with our looks yet when they find out where we come from their racist self awakens, all of a sudden we're creeps. Me and my friend never got to date, woman took one look at us and said ew..

We used to confide into eachother about maltreatment we face in this society.. how people like us don't belong here but neither back home. 

My friend, he was not just my friend he was more than that, really. He was like family. The only one who truly understood the weight of what we were carrying because he was carrying it, too. But it's been harder lately. The discrimination, the loneliness, lack of funds, sleeping from one place to another... it broke him, and I saw it happen. The man who never showed weakness, cried in front of me, said he couldn't take it anymore. That's how deep our struggles cut.

Now he's gone, and I'm here without the one person who understood everything I was going through. I'm facing these challenges alone, and I'm not sure how to handle it. The pain, the loss, it's overwhelming. He was my confidant, my support through all the ups and downs we faced in this foreign land.

Everywhere I turn, it feels like there's just more judgement, more isolation. I'm tired of being seen as just an immigrant, tired of the empty words about equality and fairness that never seem to apply to us. My friend was the one who helped me hold onto hope, but now he's not here, and that hope is harder to find.

How does one find hope in a world that seems intent on extinguishing it?",u/Emotional-Vacation39,6,"I'm really sorry to hear about loss of your friend, I know the hole will always be there and I really appreciate knowing that even a small proportion that I can connect with exists, peace be upon you | Thank you for taking time to share your thoughts, this too shall pass, just feels hard atm",1b9d0mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b9d0mp/my_friend_killed_himself_and_idk_how_to_carry_on/

I can‚Äôt bring myself to care about anything in life. 

All I want to do is lay down and do nothing till I pass away. I am sick and tired of everything. I just don‚Äôt care at all.

Our future has been robbed by climate change and our perpetually increasingly difficult economy.

It is disheartening. | No, I don‚Äôt have any friends and I don‚Äôt feel anything with my family anymore | I feel you, it sucks hard because you can never fit in with everyone else because of it too. Forever unable to understand their passion for life and trying to achieve the best, whatever that may be | Real. | Same here, I‚Äôm never seeing or meeting anyone in my life time, I‚Äôm far too unstable to have any sort of relationship with anyone anymore. | From my perspective: I‚Äôve felt this way for as long as I remember, but had none to speak to about this.

I sort of never cared until I witnessed the lives of my online friends over the years changing for the better.

One my friends graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs degree and was able to get a good job at a big company, another friend was able to start a business relatively young and it went well for them, one got married to the love of their life and moved in together. Everyone else seemingly able to get their lives together except for me.

That‚Äôs when it hit me. I was truly alone. I was stuck with nothing and nobody. I was completely stagnant. I was the only one who had such deep frustration from within towards life. I spent my life in deep isolation and repression and anger that I had realized that I wasted my life wallowing in my own misery unable to care about myself at all. 

I felt jealous. Jealous that they have a desire for life that I never had. I sabotaged my relationships and cut contact with all of them because it brought me so much pain to see them be happy.

That there‚Äôs nothing wrong going on and everything was perfectly fine. It made me despair. 

I suppose that‚Äôs what made me angry, what made me come out of my usual apathetic uncaring state.

I never cared about myself because I always hated who I am, and was never able to reconcile with myself about that. I became mostly numb about my own life, because I could always take myself out so it didn‚Äôt feel so bad.

Its just lonely to see others chase their own happiness while I cannot. I‚Äôd feel far less miserable if I could sign my own death warrant immediately than sit around and forever torment myself with the lives of those around me. | I read about that too, but it‚Äôs very hard to do especially when you don‚Äôt live alone. 

It can take up to a week to be effective which is much too long | I know. Your shrink is an asshole by the way. I hope you stopped seeing him. | We‚Äôre failed experiments, not the ideal humans. We‚Äôre nothing but cannon fodder.

Not anymore at least. | What if the spark never ignites?

I don‚Äôt really have anything or anyone in my life that matters to me deeply, I don‚Äôt remember the last time I was truly happy, I‚Äôve been angry and bitter at the world for as long as I remember. | I don‚Äôt have anything like that around and my parents are absolutely against any sort of pets in the house. | I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your struggle. You just have to keep it together for your pets, you are their world after all and you can‚Äôt abandon them. 

You have to stay alive for them, and who knows.. something good may happen along the way | Religion is part of my problem to be honest. | True | I can‚Äôt rely on false hope to be happy. It seems much more cruel to continue on a path that is uncertain for me. 

1. It‚Äôs so long ago that I genuinely don‚Äôt remember it, but I understand what you mean. 

I would say the only reason I was happy then was because I was a child. I had no responsibility and my view on the world was completely different.

2. How? Because I‚Äôm not trying to meet people. I feel utterly detached from everyone around me. Everything feels superficial and especially trying to pretend everything is fine in order to make friends with others is very hard.

3. I genuinely cannot feel anything when I watch those videos. There‚Äôs far more cruelty out there happening that it out does the kindness happening  in the video tenfold, I can‚Äôt help but be pessimistic about it.

u/Federal-Froyo2896,176,"my boyfriend will kill himself in a few days hello everyone. this is a follow up post to a post that i made about a month ago. the situation, even though i took all of the advice that i got, did not improve. it worsened and i dont know what to do. im really lost and scared.
to sum up the last post that i made, my boyfriend (20) has been feeling like his whole life is a waste and like he doesn't exist in anyone's life. he feels that he wasted his teenage years and that life won't get better, only worse, with all of the responsibilities that life brings. he doesn't want to grow old and doesn't want to accept the fact that all of his life was just emptiness. no good memories no bad memories just emptiness. no experience / no new memories in the present nor in the future can help him change the way he sees his life. it is all a waste of time and he doesnt want to continue living in this agony.

i took all the advice that i got. i am always there for him, im here to listen, im checking up on him, encouraging him to go out, to do things with me, to do things he enjoys, i help him take his mind off things, i am optimistic but not in a overwhelming way, i always understand everything he says. 

i surrounded him with new people who like him, i spoke to him about plans about the future or some trips we could take in the near future to change the environment.

i got him to go to a psychiatrist, which i all planned out like advised, but he didn't like it. the psychiatrist didn't even listen to him, was basically a bitch towards him and the whole appointment lasted for about 25 minutes because they fucked up the appointments. he took this as a sign that  even people who are paid wont listen to him. 
he doesn't want to go anymore. not to that clinic  not anywhere. doesn't want to waste money on himself anymore, refuses to take my money to go. public clinics are off the table for him. 
because of this he cant get any medication prescribed. at this point, i think that he wouldn't even take it if it was prescribed.
i told him to talk to his friends that i know love him dearly, but he refuses. he is 100% sure that nobody cares for him and that ""nobody would even come to his funeral"".

he said that he can't enjoy anything anymore and that his brain is full of thoughts of his wasted life and if anything nice happens, all he can think about is ""why didnt this happen earlier"" or ""what did i do to deserve this life""

he gave himself another week. i wouldn't be writing this if i was not 100% sure that he would do it. this is not a cry for help. this will happen if i don't do something to help. and i dont know how and what to do.

i cant call the suicide prevention line on him because it wont do any good. i cant do anything my hands are tied and i dont know what to do. please tell me how to help him. any advice is appreciated. thank you. 

 im sorry if some things i wrote did not make sense im just scared.",u/Federal-Froyo2896,-30,"i would call someone else but i know that he would rather die than be institutionalized. there is many factors that play into this (as to why he doesn't want that) i know this is starting to leave my domain and that i cant do anything to help but i can't just let him die and at the same time i can't stop him. he is slowly starting to push away from me too and i dont know what to do. i planned on maybe contacting his friends alone and trying to make them realize the gravity of the situation. maybe talking to someone else besides me will help a bit. but im still scared he would get mad at me for doing so and just do it before the one week mark he set up for himself. i dont know. im lost myself and im feeling like im already grieving as if he is already dead. | i plan on getting him to go to a different psychiatrist but he doesn't want to talk anymore. he is even slowly starting to refuse talking to me. 
any advice as to how i can make him go? i know that proper meds would help him and i already had this conversation with him, but there is no way we could get meds if he doesn't go in. 
he lost all hope there is literally nothing i can say to make him change his mind about a psychiatrist. | thank you, it really means a lot. the advice i that got gave me some hope.
im so sorry you had to go through that. i wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy. | maybe i will try to get him into some sort of group therapy. we are from europe and mental health care here is living hell. especially public institutions. | no father. he talked to his mother, reached out to her after i advised him to. she borderline doesn't care at all. she completely brushed it off.
talking to other family members is out of question for him. i already discussed this and he refuses. | he said that the only thing that could help him would be to ""go back in time 6 years"" or finding new friends. he has been trying to find new people for the past month and he did succeed in my opinion, but he still thinks that none of those people actually like him and see him as a friend. he thinks he is unimportant to those people, to everyone around him. 
he then changed his opinion and now thinks that even finding new people and trying to make up what he lost (his youth) would not be enough for him, because he realized that even if he does resolve this problem, 20 other problems would also need to be resolved and he just doesn't want to live like that, with this burden. | he has a hard time accepting and realizing that somebody cares about him due to him experiencing abandonment and overall loneliness through his whole life. before he met me, he believes nobody else cared about his existence so it's hard for him to realize that i do care and love him. 

i did not listen in. he told me word to word what happened. i made the appointment, i know that he went in. the healthcare in our country is really bad so this did not surprise me in the slightest. i myself have experienced something really similar with our mental healthcare. | this actually helped me calm down a bit. thank you for the advice. im sorry you had to go through that. nobody deserves this.
i will talk to him about some alternatives, but im trying not to be too pushy with him because i see that its bothering him and making it harder for him. ill try to find a really good psychiatrist in our area and ill see what i can do with them. 

if this doesnt work in a few days i will have to call someone else, as advised by other people in these comments. this is slowly becoming too much for me. l i feel like his whole life is on my hands and that i will be responsible for the harm that he may bring upon himself if i dont do something. 

 i will look into this and see what i can do to help. thank you again, you're really nice. i hope life treats you well. | in our country there is no such thing as emergency services for people who want to commit suicide/ will commit. i can call the police and they will maybe put him in a mental institution, which in our country are a living hell. not providing care, they literally dont give a shit. treat people like animals.
i know that that would make him even worse and it will put him on record resulting in his chances of getting a job drastically dropping, if he does live, which will make him even more suicidal. | he believes he never had proper friends. he had friends, but not real true friends who understood him and accepted him for who he is. he believes he never existed in anyones life. | thank you. im truly trying my best and this is a bit overwhelming. i have a feeling like im not doing the right thing and that i could be doing more. i will listen to all the advice that i get, so i hope i will fix my mistakes.

About his life: To be honest it‚Äôs pretty fucking miserable, he never takes anything seriously, he has the worst grades possible, he just goes to school to do nothing. I‚Äôm also concerned because he has the hobby to completely destroy the school toilet, I know this might seem funny but he literally made the school pay 300k ‚Ç¨ because he made a flooding in the school and the police are investigating. He also has a problem with porn (again might seem funny but I‚Äôm worried) he regularly sends extremely brutal pornography or people having sex with dead animals,he also has the problem that he doesn‚Äôt care abt his body att all, idk if he regularly drinks alcohol, but recently he emptied an entire bottle of some liquid (stuff to rinse your mouth) to drunk himself, he apparently puked 3-5 times.

The problem is, that he doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it, I mean he kept it a secret for 4 years and regretted telling us immediately.

The consumeristic and materialistic society is disgusting and I hate the thought that I'm going to have to work my ass off every day until I'm 70 for some shitty company just to barely afford groceries while the big guys just keep getting richer. It's crushing me. I wish we would go back to a society where people grow their own food, and barter and trade with each other.

u/GhostingOut,493,"Existence is genuinely horrifying when you think about it You‚Äôre born into the world beyond your choice, and just have to accept it. You‚Äôre not guaranteed to have a good - or even decent - life, and will likely end up having the complete opposite. You‚Äôre essentially doomed to live miserably in third world countries.

From before you‚Äôre able to think for yourself, you‚Äôre fed a load of bullshit dogma about life & morals in the hopes you‚Äôll become just another cog in the shitty systems that run the world.

You‚Äôll be heavily discriminated against for having traits that aren‚Äôt your choice. Every world leader is an egomaniac who puts their interests and beliefs above all else; billionaires who could actually do some good are just higher valued pawns to them.

Most of the world‚Äôs population are idiots (including you & I) because we were made to be, growing up. People just swallow whatever their gods in office tell them; believing the lies and propaganda which just causes fallout between the masses, keeping us distracted as to not notice the real enemies.

So, you‚Äôre expected to live in a world like this until it kills you. Suicide is condemned yet it‚Äôs the only way out of this living hell, and if you do push through and live your life, you‚Äôll probably just die unsatisfied about it and with more regret than you would‚Äôve had.

u/Illustrious-Donut947,178,"My whole life was fake, now it's hell... Sorry if this is really long, also marked NSFW for involving suicide talk (15 M) Ever since I could remember, my life was amazing. My parents were a happy couple, I was homeschooled, had little to no responsibilities, had a homeschool group of friends, life was good...Up until I turned 13...

A few months after I turned 13, I noticed my parents fighting a lot, they did fight in the past but not very often. The fights got more and more intense and turned into screaming matches, I would be huddled up in my room comforting my siblings as they cried, while I was trying to figure out what they were talking about.

On my parents anniversary, my parents friends came over (via request from my mom) without my dad's permission, to talk about my parents marriage and see if they could help. My dad hates surprises so he freaked out and went down to his computer in the basement after yelling ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS FOR?!?!"" My mom started crying and went to hangout at their friends for the night. This is where everything went to hell. My dad told me later that night they were never a good couple, they always fought, we just never heard them.

They tried some counseling sessions for a month and nothing worked, frankly I think it made it worse. Eventually my mom started causing trouble, telling my parents friends all the bad things my dad in their marriage, but not saying a thing about her part in it. My friends believed her and she slowly turned all my parents friends against my dad.

Fast forward a few months my mom is living in the basement since she can't move anywhere else as of that time, and my dad is in extreme depression, after losing all his friends to an unjust cause, and failing at fixing the marriage. I start experiencing depression and start becoming suicidal. My dad start dating a woman since my mom refused to sign divorce papers yet.

My mom eventually starts provoking my dad, saying things she knows triggers him, and starts calling the police whenever he slips, even though he doesn't mean it. One night my parents had a talk and my mom agreed she would not record the conversation...Sure enough, she did. This led to my dad threatening by saying he's gonna hire a junkie to have her killed.

After that night while my dad was at work, she called the police and had him arrested at work in front of all his co-workers, embarrassing him and he was fired on the spot. My dad was in jail for the night, but his girlfriend bailed him out, and he moved into her apartment.

Eventually after some court stuff we were allowed to visit my dad once a week.

This is where I was the most suicidal, my mom made me the dad of the house, forcing everything on me, chores, punishing my siblings, cooking, while my mom would just sleep/Hangout in her room, barely working her part time job. She would mentally abuse me, comparing me to people she hates, punishing me for the stupidest things, and not letting me leave the house. I started realizing my dad just wanted peace in the divorce, while my mom was out for blood. Eventually after some court stuff we were allowed to visit my dad twice a week. Though that wasn't enough. Eventually I set a date for  myself on my calendar, so in a week I would commit suicide. 

Then I came up with an idea, I would pack my bag and bring it with me the next time I go to my dad's, I would tell him I'm staying with him and I wasn't going back. He was completely fine with it, he put me in a school, and the court said my primary residence would be with my dad, due to education purposes. So since 6 months ago, I have been living with my dad, his girlfriend, her son and her daughter, and her dog. And my mom refuses to give up this needless fight, and I don't think she plans on ending it any time soon. (Again so sorry if this was long, I needed to vent:/",u/Illustrious-Donut947,9,"Thanks, and yes, my dad's place I've actually been able to think and speak freely without being shut down | I meant slip as in he would say things he didn't mean, but only because he was provoked by my mom.

u/Imaginary-Ad7066,112,"Heard my family shit-talking about a person who committed suicide‚Ä¶ So, yesterday night during rush hour when people usually travel home, someone committed suicide by jumping in front of a major train line which caused delays. My sister and I had to take different routes to our respective homes. Today when I woke up, my sister‚Äîafter dropping her kid to daycare‚Äîcame to visit us and was talking to my grandparents in our living room (I was still in bed and could hear them talking). Here‚Äôs the conversation:

Sister: why do they have to do such a thing which will inconvenience so many people when you can do it for free at home? Are they not thinking?

Grandma: They‚Äôre not thinking. That‚Äôs why do it. 

Grandpa: What happened?

Sister: Someone jumped in front of a train yesterday.

Grandpa: That‚Äôs so stupid.

Grandma: Why don‚Äôt they just jump into the sea or something? 

I was shocked by how insensitively and nonchalantly they spoke of someone who fucking died‚Äîsomeone who felt so alone that they chose to take their life. I‚Äôve been aware of how insensitive my family are about people who suffer from depression or commit suicide, but today I‚Äôve truly realized what huge assholes they are. I‚Äôve been suicidal for over fifteen years now, I cope with life by self-harming and have been doing it for fifteen years. 

My mom knows (though she doesn‚Äôt know the scope of how much I cut). It‚Äôs definitely been a couple of years since we talked about my depression and I‚Äôm convinced that she thinks I‚Äôve stopped cutting. My sister also knows that I cut, but I guess she doesn‚Äôt really care cause she never asks. I don‚Äôt care that she doesn‚Äôt care, because once upon a time when I was naive enough to confide in her, she told me to ‚Äújust be happy‚Äù and that there are people who are actually truly suffering in the world, so I should just think positively about life.

I still go to a psychiatrist but apparently everyone has forgotten that I‚Äôm still getting help. Every minute of waking life is spent thinking about killing myself‚Äîit‚Äôs rare that I can distract myself from it. I‚Äôm not even thirty yet and I want to die. I do have a feeling that someday I will take my life‚Äîit almost feels like fate. Hearing my family speak about suicide like that made me feel like maybe I should just get it over with. 

P.s.: I‚Äôm not looking to be consoled or comforted, or seeking help. Just wanted to share cause this sub is the only place where someone will understand how diabolical my family is.

u/Impossible_Key_4235,476,"Life Has Turned Me Into the Villain  I get it. This is how people ""go bad."" This is how people become cruel and uncaring. This is how people do horrible things to themselves and others. 

They start off with ambitions, hopes, and dreams. They want to have good things, and believe they'll get them, if they work hard enough. They try. They fail. They try harder, only to fail harder, in multiple areas of their lives. Over and over again. 

Every failure makes them more bitter and hopeless. It gets worse every year. Each birthday is a self-check-in. ""What goals did I accomplish in the past 365 days?"" Not a single one. 

They see everyone around them doing better, or at least improving slowly. Meanwhile, they have no verifiable progress in anything, despite working hard. Still in a miserable job, despite sending out hundreds of applications and completing certifications to boost their resume. Still unhealthy and overweight, despite exercising -- probably picked up a new physical ailment in the process. (Diabetes, thyroid problems, back problems, etc.)

They're still single, or in a toxic/unfulfilling/dead relationship. All their friends are gone, whether they've moved away or not. Silence kills more friendships than distance ever has.

Every single dream is on its deathbed. Lack of time and skills, or just everything else in ""adulthood"" being ""more important."" Or, maybe they realized all the other things that go into their dream, and have concluded they simply aren't cut out for it. Too old to start. Too introverted. Too unsure. Too broke to invest in it.

When everything goes wrong in the exact wrong ways, despite best efforts, what else can anyone conclude? The universe/god/gods/whatever doesn't want you to succeed. You were put here to suffer and fail because you lack the fundamental elements of self to do better. No amount of therapy can fix that.

When everything is taken away, what's left? No hopes, no dreams, no light. There's no reason to be a better person if you get kicked down for it.

This is how villains are created. Negativity doesn't form in a vacuum. When the universe hates you, you hate it back. When I die, I hope I don't see ""god."" I don't want to meet my abuser.

u/Interesting-Tip-4548,290,"I‚Äôm 50 years old and I just want to give up. I‚Äôm tired, I don‚Äôt have anything that brings me joy any more.  I used to work on home projects, cars, all sorts of things.  Now I just get frustrated and angry.  I used to read all the time, now I get ten pages in and just feel like fuck this.  Work is just going through the paces, I feel like I‚Äôm not even there even when I am.  I really want to die, I would kill myself if not for my wife and kids.  I won‚Äôt kill myself until they‚Äôre out of college and my wife is passed (she will probably outlive me though, so I have to keep getting up every damn day).  My wife doesn‚Äôt want sex anymore, I don‚Äôt know.  I have guns, I can easily kill myself, a .40 caliber round through the brain stem.  I just can‚Äôt do it because I have all these people to support.

I‚Äôm looking for new jobs.  I don‚Äôt seem to be in demand as a senior hardware engineer, or at least I don‚Äôt get calls back.  I‚Äôm taking drugs to make me feel happy.  They kill the anxiety but not the perpetual sadness.  That‚Äôs another thing I can‚Äôt fucking control, I cry all the damn time.  I try to stop, shove push pins in my thighs, nothing works.  Not very manly for damn sure.  I can usually control it in public but my kids see it sometimes and that just makes me feel worse.

Counselors are too damn expensive, though I am taking prescription drugs that help.  Sorry, this is too long, you get the picture.  Ahhh I just wish I would die quickly from something.

EDIT:  Thank you everyone for your support, it means a lot.  I have no friends so it‚Äôs good to know that other people at least have some empathy for what I‚Äôm feeling.  I‚Äôm trying, and I‚Äôll keep getting up and working for my family.  Deep down, though, I‚Äôm hoping a bus hits me or someone randomly decides to kill me.

I have no friends any more because I don‚Äôt have time to keep in touch (or maybe I‚Äôm too depressed to talk to friends).  I haven‚Äôt been out with anyone outside my family in over a year.  Life is mostly sadness and I‚Äôm just done with it, I‚Äôm ready to check out and not wake up. | Oh yeah, they know.

Really just fed up with the world. I don't have the strength it requires to be a man. For that reason I'll never have a family. I mean I'll never be valuable enough for a women to love me, nor am I strong enough to have children (I would like both of these at some point, I'm greedy.) Women have all the options in the world and my value is far less than many other men, even my friends. I don't blame women for choosing the best, nor do I hate them or anything like that, I'm just sad I'm not one of those men.  
I have dreams of opening a school one day, something that's better than the way our public school runs. Seems like people who are way smarter than me are already achieving that though.

u/ItsGonnaGetUgly,92,"Never had any interests and Waiting to die at 20. I was diagnosed with depression at 7 years old after my mom found notes from me about wanting to kms or die in general. So for as long as I can remember I've just kinda been ""bleh"". I didn't really fit in with a lot of other kids cause I never wanted anything. I never had a dream job, a big achievement I wanted to do, a desire to have good grades, get into a good college, have money, have a car, become independant, etc. For all of school up until 12th grade I just did what I needed to get by, and didn't care that I was rapidly losing oppurtunities. I never got my license because I didn't care and don't want to.   
  
I eventually graduated and didn't care in the slightest. Now there's nothing I want to do or necessarily ""have"" to do anymore, so I don't care. I know theres no ""point"" to life except for what you make of it but what if everything you could make it makes you miserable? Years of college sounds miserable and theres nothing I could tolerate for a career that would make me any happier than I am now. Theres no little bucket list things I wanna do like travel, or some achievement in some kind of hobby in between a sucky job, I just don't care. I don't wanna make anything of life because I don't care. I don't really think theres beauty in the fact that we're alive and even if there is in some weird spiritual way, I don't care. Everything I could ever imagine doing sounds so much more lame and exhaushing than doing nothing. I've been doing absolutely nothing since I've graduated for the most part and honestly I'm not sad. I've been sad before many times in my life but right now isn't one of them. If I could, I'd just sit and do nothing but eat food and go back to sleep for 60 years and I'd feel fine probably. I only feel upset when I have to do things I don't care to do, in order to get things I don't care to get. Which is all of life. 

It just kinda feels like I'm waiting to die. I'd rather not do it myself and I don't plan to at all, but it feels like everything I've ever wanted in life has already happened. If I don't do something though, my unwillingness to do anything is gonna start hurting people around me that I care about, and I hate that. On the other side though, if I did die, a lot of people I know would be upset about it. It's a lose lose. I don't hate it enough though to do anything about it, because at that point I'd be torturing myself for the next 40-60 years just to keep other people happy. And I can't say why I'm sad because they just get scared I'm gonna kms, say nothing, or leave me, and then I feel worse (not a blind assumtion, these things did happen to me many times). I don't get satisfaction in anything, even in the things google says are ""the best dopamine givers 2024 working real.""   
  
I hate outside, too many bugs and other bs, and even under the perfect circumstances for outside which I have felt, I just don't care enough to be out there. I've had pets before but feeding them and keeping them alive and happy hasn't really done anything for me. And it feels awful saying that and it feels awful to expect something out of it but jesus fucking christ I just wanna feel something. I had a girlfriend for a bit in highschool that I was really happy with and the only way we could've stayed together was if I went to college and moved with her but holy shit I can't do that. It's not worth it despite being with her was the only point in my entire life I actually felt joy. I don't even think I wanna try to get with anyone else to see if that'd make me happy again because the way I think about life makes me impossible to live with without being miserable all the time. I don't wanna just throw my entire will to live on some random poor girl's shoulders, that'd be awful. And I don't wanna learn to get better because I don't care enough too, I'd rather die. And I know the fact I'm alive makes dying not an option, so I should just find a way to live but jesus fuck I hate that, every single way I could spend my time I hate and it makes me so much more upset and miserable than doing nothing. But even doing nothing causes people pain. And ending it myself would also do that, and it's scary. So now I'm waiting for something to do it for me, and in the meantime doing absolutely nothing, cause it's the only thing that doesn't make me sad.

I'm also hoping something will change, or at least you and I will start liking something enough to actually enjoy it, and make stuff worth it. I don't have any advice tbh given my situation but I wish you luck in finding something someday, whatever that's worth. | Yeah I did kinda gloss over it. I've been seeing a therapist since probably exactly a year now, and started wellbutrin a few months back from a psychiarist. I'm gonna be starting zoloft as well next week. I didn't bring it up because it didn't feel substantial enough and hasn't helped a huge ton, none of the meds have really done anything yet.

I do art too sometimes and thought of persuing it but I find myself disliking doing the art despite being somewhat competant, I'm not amazing or anything at all but I force myself to do it sometimes to try to see if I can go anywhere with it and I just truly dislike doing it. I honestly could do more cause I haven't experienced some stuff, but I've already tried everything I'm moderately interested in a good bit.

Yeah so i am gonna kill myself soon, i literally give up. I hate when people tell me to ""never give up"", like you havent been in my fucking shows man. Im actually sick of this generation and this social media shit. Im from the middle east and moved here (edit:Australia) when i was 7 and was bullied to now. I used to have friends but those turned against me and i was suicidal fron late 2020 to still now. My dad always said that death is the best thing because you dont have to worry about anything whenever. I dont think i care if i get hurt or shot or any of that. Yes ive also talked to my fucking close friend about this and i still remember him crying over disocrd call, begging me not to do it. I was quiet whike he was crying. I also talked tk the councillors and yeah parents got told, they got a shock and supprted me. After a few months I stopped being depressed and yeah and now after new years i feel depressed.

This time i just dont care anymore. Im literally not caring about school or anything i just want to be gone. I go to a fucking christian school, get told to read the bible everyday and i do but nothing happens. What a fucking waste of time "" read and he will guide you"" like bitch im about to kill myself and im not caring about school and you call that a "" god's plan for you"" fuck outra here bro. Im also fat and have literally given up losing weight. I look on yt and it never works. I have fucking ADD and take meds. I watch porn when its night and i play games instead of homework. My life is basically done woth this year 11 shit. 

Cya later might not be there to reply

(Edit: (this might be a whole essay)

Thank you guys so much for the support, to be honest i never thought people would actually respond and stuff. I an feeling better now and reading these comments just shows that there are people in the world who actually care. I over-exagerated some of the things I said here. Yes I was suicidal for a while and now that something happened at school and the support i got from my parents yesterday, I am doing alright. I have had friends who commited suicide because of what things you and I have gone through. To those people out there who have friends that are like sad or dont talk much or feeling down, talk to them. I also think that ending it all is just not the solution. Like I get it, I was suicidal and I also thought ending it was the only solution, but just do something productive yk. Go for a walk, swim, talk to parenrs or siblings or anyone. Walking is great in my opinion because you enjoy the scenery and it makes you forget about the depression stuff. 

If you also have watched tiktoks about ""real"" please fucking delete it. The thing is that when you look it at these slideshows, makes you get upset because you ""relate"" to it. Watching it more will get worse. 

I would love to one day make a discord server for the lonely people, no matter the age and gender and whatever, yk to talk and chat and make friends. 

And for the depressed/suicidal people out there, listen to me, just because you had a bad day today does not mean its always going to be bad. Yesterday i had a fucking rough day and now im feeling good and everything. Just imagine this, if you were dead you wouldnt be able to do the cool shit like drive a car, shoot a gun, kiss and have sex with a girl or boy, everything yk. Like if you feel/-are depressed/suicidal, just go outside wether its day or night and breathe in and out. Think as hard as you can the ways and solutions to your problems. Getting bullied? Hit em back or report it to the teacher. Abused by your parents? Tell a friend, teacher, anyone. Go to the gym, i just came back from school and signed up for the gym. Who cares if you dont know what to do at the gym, give everyrhing a try and see how it is. Try cool shit in your life yk. If your going through stuff then share it on reddit, the lads here are very supportive, my dms got flooded with requests. If you need anything comment and ill do everything to help you, just dont kill yourself.

Thank you.)

God isn't doing anything in my life. My positive thoughts aren't materializing. I don't even feel connection to the shit I believe in and am wishing for. My mind is literally turned off. I made muliple vision boards, read affirmations everyday, and do all the shit you're suppose to do. I can't do it anymore. 

I've been praying for a job that I can start and get into and that will pay me all the money I need and more. I've been battling unemployment and under paying jobs for damn a year and some change. I am beyond that.

I might have to move back into my parents tiny disgusting home. I HATE THIS SHIT. I'm behind on so many bills. 

I got a call for a job making $17-$19 but I had to pay $140 for a background check and license in a field that is not the one I set out to pursue. I DON'T HAVE $140 TO GIVE TO A JOB BEFORE I START WORKING IT. On top of that, it could take up to a month to get the license. So I'm out $140 and have to wait a month to even start working. BULLSHIT

I literally don't know what to do. What's the point of all that believing and shit if it don't work. I apply to so many jobs every day. I even made multiple resumes and shit. I literally don't know what to do.

I know I am lucky to have the sick leave option, but I was supposed to start in a new grup and a new role when I got my 3rd major depressive episode. Now my transfer was paused and I have been on sick leave for 2 months now, and I assume I will be for half a year or so. I am afraid I will lose my job and my career completely once they figure out why am I on sick leave (I am an engineer).

I live with my 37y old boyfriend, we have been together for 9 years. We have best years of our lives to each other. But last 2 years were really bad. He told me in yesterday's walk he is really sorry I have depression, but he does not want a depressed partner and he will not push me, but I should prepare to start searching for a new flat.

I don't have a successful career. I don't own a property. I don't have a family of my own. My time is running out.

I am medicated. Escitalopram, 4 days in 15 mg. My 3rd escitalopram rodeo, so far I took it 2 years at 26 and 2 years at 30 years old.

Anybody has some advice? Anybody going through the same? Anybody thinks things do get better eventually? Somewhere deep, very deep inside, I am hopefull. For us all in this subreddit.

Thank you all ‚ù§Ô∏è",u/Master-Ad-7261,8,"Hi, thank you for replying. It is hard, I know. I live abroad in western EU, and with rents going even higher and me being on sick leave, having to move flats will be mission impossible. I can always move back to my parents and their house, but it is in the middle of nowhere in eastern EU. But I will have to tackle that in the beginning of next year. 

I am in the process, no matter how embarrasing to go through that at 34, but facing that my hopes, dreams and potentials will not be fulfilled.

Great idea with the back problem, I will use that once I am back, thank you.

Wish you all the best, enjoy your hometown and family time, as much as you can :) | This is such a sweet post, thank you so much. I am doing the minimum baby steps - I sleep, I eat, today I even cooked a quick lunch, and although I have been in bed most of the time (it is 16.30 now), I hope I can go to the nearby gym for some walks and easy exercise. So far it has worked in the last 3/4 days in a row. I want to continue that. All the rest is optional.

I also have a small notebook near by with some tiny task ideas - wash my face and put on some creams, eat breakfast, take meds and then I put little ticks next to them when I accomplish them. Feels nice.

Depression is such a pain in the ass, really :D | I'm sorry to hear your struggles, you did not have an easy road. But you are really brave for going back to work! I hope you still somewhat manage to take care of your mental health as much as you can. I know the feeling of the fear of losing your job - and I live in Europe, I don't thinkI could ever survive in US. But I still lived for couple of years at least with the fear of being let go with a huge imposter syndrome (I am an engineer, topics were too hard for me). And it broke me now. But I am also hopefull in recovery and eventually things getting better for us all. I wish you a lot of bravery and all the best! ‚ù§Ô∏è | Thank you for replying! I understand not having a career, I tried so hard and pushed so much to make something out of myself, but I went into the wrong field and now I don't have much I can build upon or opportunity to switch. Or I am just blind and depressed so I don't see.

Good luck to you too, therapy is a great support. | To you too, from an unwell Croatian ‚ù§Ô∏è | Thank you for the kind words. I am in the process of learning to put myself first and focus on healing and getting better. And it is slowly getting better day by day. What blows my mind is that this is my 3rd depression episode since we have been in a relationship, 9 years. But the first two were long distance, so it was easy to shut off. I hoped he would be more supportive. | Glad to hear you are doing better! Yes my first depression episode at 26 y old opened me up for a lot of spiritual topics (not relogious though). I admit I never heard of IFS, I will mention it to my therapist. I live abroad in a foreign country, loss of my community is a big hit to me, much more than I care to admit.

Regarding sick leave, I am fearful the effect it will have on my career as I do work in tech as an engineer, but I had to take the time off even if it costs me my job. I simply had too much, I stopped eating or sleeping and it broke me. I do need to follow up with doctors regularly that give me the sick leave note and take my meds. I only pay for my therapist because getting one over health insurance is mission impossible. I don't see how I could ever survive in America, so my heart goes to you that you need to go through these hardships. | I would love to do a witchcraft with a coven :D I am not religious. I live abroad, outside of my native country so I am also struggling with finding a community. I have some friends here and there, most of them with family and kids.

I had to leave work for some time as it was very triggering. At the moment I am still getting used to the meds, they cause me to sleep 15 hours a day. But also staying away for long is risky for my job and my livelihood and keeping the roof over my head, so I have to consider that soon. I hope I can go back to work in January.

Yup, my boyfriend is an ass. Unfortunately with a roomate I can't, as the flat we are in only has a bedroom and a living room and a kitchen together. So there is no separate room for another person to move in. Unless I go sleep in the living room. Maybe not the worst idea ever :D

Thank you for replying to my post :) | I'm sorry to hear relationship with your dad is not that good. At least you have your mom to count on ‚ù§Ô∏è I am lucky in that regard, I can always move back home, they always tell me this is your home too and it will be yours and your brother's one day (they own a house), I also have a great relationship with my brother and some girl friends from back home still regulary check up with me knowing what I am going through, they write at least once a week. I am very blessed.

We also had two stray cats that were born in our back yard and we managed to get them domestic enough that we can pet them and they are coming to us every day for food, we take them to the vet and so. They brought me a lot of joy when I visit home :)

You are right, I can also move in, at least temporarily, into a shared flat. I will find a way.

But I am so tired. I am 20 and I feel more than ready. Something has given me the final push. I have planned it for tonight. I am scared. But I am ready. I have no one to tell or say goodbye to who would want to hear it. 

I want to put it down somewhere so if it works, I can be remembered for what I‚Äôm about to say. 

I tried to be kind.

I have no diagnosis spart from depression and anxiety. The doctors don‚Äôt care. They just sent me home with 50mg of an antidepressant 2 years ago. I‚Äôve been self harming for 7 years. I‚Äôve had therapists and counselling and none of it works. I don‚Äôt feel compatible to the world. I don‚Äôt think there is help for someone like me. I‚Äôm so so sorry you feel the same way.

But obviously I‚Äôm not thinking rationally I guess. I appreciate you so much. All I‚Äôve ever wanted was to have fun. To have a family. To have love. I hope you get it! | Your comment has made me cry. I see so much love within you too. But I don‚Äôt know how I could possibly continue through this.

I‚Äôm scared that after I log off that I will still go ahead with my plan. Do you think I should phone a helpline before going to A&E? Or straight there? I don‚Äôt want to be a joke.

I really appreciate your kindness. It‚Äôs exactly what I need right now. | Thank you so much!! I needed this perspective | Your message is so heartwarming. Thank you so much for this hope.

I was in a terrible position and for now I‚Äôm trying to survive the night. I enjoy art and scary films. I love animals and all things to do with cats. I will try to focus on the good. I appreciate e you more than you know! | Hey, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve experienced this indescribable pain. It‚Äôs horrible. I am so thrilled to hear that you‚Äôre healing. I have suffered with depression and self harm for 7 years. Tonight it reached a boiling point. I came here to get my final thoughts out. I‚Äôm so grateful for all the love I‚Äôve received. I didn‚Äôt expect it but I‚Äôm so happy I found it. I hope I can heal. I hope I can come back and tell you of my progress. Thank you for helping me. For being there for me. It‚Äôs truly appreciated.

Message me if you feel like talking ü´Çüíï | I‚Äôm in a terrible place emotionally right now. Holding on for dear life in fact, thanks to the help of others. I do not find your comment helpful. I understand what you‚Äôre trying to say, but I don‚Äôt think it is very kind to me, or to the people reading the comments. | Thank you! I‚Äôm so scared to stay. What if it gets worse? It‚Äôs so hard. 5 years, 10 years even ONE year feels so FAR away and hard to achieve. 

I have considered fitness but I am not fit. At all. People would definitely laugh at me. I would be the joke of the gym. I am so happy for you. I am happy that it worked. | Hey, I‚Äôm sorry to have made you think like that, it was not my intentionü´Çüíï My parents do love me, it just feels like they don‚Äôt like me, but it‚Äôs more complicated than that. Unfortunately last night I did not feel loved by anyone until I found all these comments. I‚Äôm so grateful for strangers, including yourself, who have kept me distracted long enough to stay away from my plan. I would never want to hurt my parents, I would never want to be selfish. I just feel so much pain. Thank you for your supportüíï | I wasn‚Äôt brought up into a religion. I‚Äôm not sure what to believe. Thank you for your words‚ù§Ô∏è | I‚Äôm sorry you feel this way.

That is helpfulü´Ç | Thank you. I hate that you have felt that way. Sometimes I get thoughts making me think I‚Äôm mean. I think that people were right to hurt me. But sometimes I think I‚Äôm nice. I want to help people. I have helped people but I felt so drained. I love your comment and appreciate you so much. Thank you for being a kind person. For helping me today. I hope I can be like you. | I expected a better life. I was told I was a smart child. I was expecting to be successful and to be loved. I am so heartbroken by the reality of life that it‚Äôs overwhelming. Thank you for your comment. | I think I might need some help. I‚Äôm in the uk. I appreciate this more than you know. | I was so close to doing it that I am scared. I am so glad I found you guys. I should‚Äôve reached out sooner. I didn‚Äôt know I could find people to help me like this, I felt so alone. Thank you so much for being here and for reaching out. I really appreciate it.

I really appreciate you <3 | Thank you so much! I‚Äôm definitely living day by day at the moment. It‚Äôs the only way through right now. I appreciate your advice‚ù§Ô∏è | Thank you. I do appreciate what you‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs just so hard to accept that I‚Äôll never live my dreams. I truly do believe I am not going to be loved romantically. Even my friends have told me they could never see it happening. I am not pretty at all. My personality is very flawed. And beyond all of that surface level stuff, I am drained. I don‚Äôt even want to prove that I‚Äôm loveable because I know I‚Äôm not. I would quite like to talk to you. I just feel so lonely. | I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôve felt this way too! I‚Äôm so happy you are here to share your story and to help me tonight. I have posters of national parks in my bedroom because I have some that I always wanted to visit. Hopefully I can make it there too! Thank you for your comment. I appreciate you. | Thank you for listening and hearing. It‚Äôs so nice to be understood. It‚Äôs new to me and I‚Äôm very grateful. I do have dreams they felt out of reach but I see now that they‚Äôre not. I would like to visit many places. I have posters of American national parks on my wall, I wanted to visit them but I‚Äôve never had the chance. I wanted to live a happy life. I wanted to live by a lake and trees. I want to be with my animals. I want to help people in the way you‚Äôve all helped me. I hope I can do these things and I will be writing them down as you suggest. I want to make it through tonight. Hopefully seeing them will remind me of the good things in life. I love my animals and I truly wouldn‚Äôt be here without them, or without posting this tonight quite honestly. I feel so much love from you, thank you for your words of wisdom and encouragement. I really needed them tonight. You have helped me. You really have. | Thank you for reminding me that these are not truths and just thoughts. | Thank you so muchüò≠ I hope I find the love you have shown me again one day. I will be looking for support groups after last night, I accept that I need help, and as scary as it is to say that and to move away from my plan, I am slightly hopeful that there is a better option.

No one has ever seen me that way. I doubt anyone ever will. | I‚Äôm in a low right now. It‚Äôs so low that I find it hard to see out of it. Your words aren‚Äôt empty.

I hope I can find that passion. | Thank you so much for listening to me and checking in. It‚Äôs shocking me that people actually care. I feel undeserving of this love.

Your words have kept me going! These comments are what have given me the strength to push through. I have been in a terrible place emotionally over the last few days.

For helping me and for checking inüíïüíï | It seems impossible for now, but if I give up it will be impossible. Thank you for giving me a new perspective to consider. If I make it to that concert I will think of you! Hopefully I can update you one day. Having someone believe in me is really special. It‚Äôs touched my heart more than you know.

That might be enough for me. | Thank you so much. I‚Äôm crying rn because I feel so overwhelmed with gratitude. I‚Äôve never been uplifted and cared for in this way. I‚Äôve always felt out of place and the last few years have really kicked the life out of me. Tonight I came to a decision and you are making me second guess it. I do want happiness. I do want to feel better. And you‚Äôre right. All I‚Äôm feeling is emotions. That can change. It‚Äôs just so hard to push through them right now. Thank you for making it that bit easier. I never expected this support. | I like your perspective. It is hopeful. Thank you so much. I hope to find such a passion. | Sis :) I really hope they do! I‚Äôll try my best.

I was in a terribly dark place, I would not have even thought about being mean to you when you were trying to be there for me‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm grateful for you.

It‚Äôs hard to believe in something I don‚Äôt know is there‚ù§Ô∏è | Thank you for this!‚ù§Ô∏è | Thank you for saying that‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôll make that appointment! | People in the comments are pointing out our youth, I have been feeling old lately but I realise everything is about perspective. To others we are babies. So I‚Äôm that sense I hope we find happiness too. I think we feel so much but I think that can be good. I think we are both compassionate and that‚Äôs a beautiful thing.

I agree, I feel like I need to leave this town. I feel caged and trapped. I feel bad for feeling I‚Äôve outgrown it but it‚Äôs the truth. I just need something new. Somewhere that doesn‚Äôt remind me of my pain. I would love to volunteer one day. I don‚Äôt know why I feel so trapped in my own mind. I wish I was more motivated to do these things because you‚Äôre right, they would help me see a bigger picture. I might just look into volunteering options near me‚Ä¶ it feels about time I put myself forward. It‚Äôs scary but I know if I don‚Äôt do something soon that there will be no way out.

I am watching a new documentary that I am interested in. I‚Äôm having good food tonight.

I'll never feel what that joy feels like. I'm cursed with this sickness. this perpetual sadness that engulfs every living moment of mine. no will to live whatsoever. scared to imagine the next day. too tired wishing this day would end. and living in this state of mind for almost a decade. what did i do to have this cursed fate - I'll never know. something's wrong with me. i cared so much for people. remembered their birthdays and wished them at midnight. very few remembered mine. because who tf am i, right? some worthless piece of scum. i probably deaerve this what's happening to me.

hadn't cried since a long time. but the day i cried had to be my birthday. just great. ",u/Miek2Star,4,"more like envious. or hopeless that i wont ever feel what they feel | i know. i know. happy people also feel sad sometimes. but i hate that their default baseline mood is still of positive emotion and thoughts. they feel happy most of the time, and sad sometimes. whereas its the opposite for me (or us). i have friends who i consider 'happy people' but i feel like if i ever tell them I'm sad, or share my feelings, they'll feel sad. and i dont think someone should ever feel sad because of me. I've hurt enough people already. 


>All I can say is instead of focusing on how other people's happiness, you should focus on how you can work on yours.

tried that. but failed miserably at it. i dont think the next day will be any different from today, but like to believe that one day i miraculously wont be depressed anymore | well I'll disagree with you there. i love people. i love the human race. i just hate myself. i dont believe that the majority of people are hypocrites, egocentric and materialists, but even if they are - so are you, dont you think? | wish i could abandon social media. but so many friends in my life would disappear if i quit social media. i know its a shallow friendship, but i hate being alone | relate to that to the very core. moment I'm with people, all my negative thoughts become very passive. almost silent. like they never existed. moment I'm left alone, hell. 

idk if people make me happy. but by some force of nature my negative thoughts go sushhh when I'm with my friend(s) | i **am** an extrovert. not the chatterbox that keeps speaking all the time and annoys people. I'm an extrovert and i speak in balance, not too much, not too little. only thing I'm unable to talk about is my feelings | honestly wish it gets better for both of us. wanna connect personally? | yup. totally. i can almost never watch a romantic movie. there was one time where i was watching one, and the couple started getting intimate or something, and i said ""yup,, that's it"" and shut my laptop and immediately started sobbing. heh. | hey. that's terrible what he does. that is very very pathetic behavior. he's been doing this and you're fine with it? did you not raise a concern or face him? why are you still with this person?? 

also, i see you're pregnant; is he the father? | sucks too bad man. i don't even know what's wrong or what's causing it. there was incidents in my life which i think are causing it, but they're minor. which happen in everyone's lives. nothing like trauma or abuse. still i feel what i feel and i have no explanation why.

yeah i've tried therapy and even took antidepressants for a year - after which i was totally normal until i wasn't normal again. therapy was shit. | >a reminder to not compare your insides to other people‚Äôs (carefully crafted) outsides.

hey, that's a nice insight. thanks for sharing. | idk man. i hate myself too much to be putting effort into *me*. its counterintuitive, i know. but it is what it is, and i have no motivation to do any basic tasks. if i could, i'd just lay in my bed all day. but if i did that - i'll be anxious that i'm not being productive. it's like- if i'm in my bed, i'm anxious. if i'm not, i'm depressed. unproductive in both. i hate myself so much that even if something good happens to me, i'll feel like i didn't deserve it. or at least didn't earn it, i got it purely by chance or a miracle. and all the times i've tried helping myself, i've failed miserable. so now i'm at a point where i don't see the point in trying anymore. | hey friend, how are you doing? | happy birthday to you in advance! 

i think the contrary. happy people follow the same routine and be happy, but depressed people also follow a routine but are unhappy. its not about a routine. 
i consider myself being a fairly modest and kind person, but that's got nothing to do with my mood or state of depression. in fact, when I'm depressed and someone bothers me, I'm likely to snap or shout at them.

u/National_Tone_970,229,"I am an 18 year old Japanese high school girl with depression. Please advise me. Hello. I live in Japan and my father and mother are Japanese. My father and mother divorced when I was very young and I was raised by my father and grandmother. I am 18 years old and a senior in high school and will graduate from high school in March! I am currently receiving medication for depression with the help of a lawyer and living alone on the rental income from the hospital my father left me. In Japan, most young people go to college, and the university rank system is quite strict... I frequently think about death due to the pressure of exams. I am very worried that because I am ugly, I will not be able to make friends or be taken seriously because of my low academic background. But that's the case everywhere, isn't it...?
I am very afraid to live. Ever since I was little, my life has been a battle against bullies and school caste. I have had rarefied thoughts since the eighth grade and transferred to a high school that allowed home schooling during my freshman year of high school.
I feel like I am going crazy when I see sns. Many young people in Japan worry about their faces and consider plastic surgery from a young age. Too often we are judged by our education and appearance, but ironically, we are so lucky to be able to worry about every single thing like that.
I wonder if I should be living so idly on the inheritance my parents left me. I don't... Really... Afraid to live... I don't even know what I'm afraid of anymore.
I'm sorry that I'm having these shitty worries because I'm weak and only care about what people think of me, while there are so many people who are struggling to live their day.",u/National_Tone_970,57,"Indeed!!! üòÉIn Japan, depending on their parents' wealth and not working (called NEET) is greatly despised ü•≤ but maybe that's ok.

The counselor is very kind. | Thank you very much! Studying abroad has always been a dream of mine.

She and my father cut ties, so no one knows where or how she is living. I wish I could meet her. My father was a doctor. He loved me very much. He and my grandmother worked very hard to raise me. My father's behavior became increasingly strange. When I came home from school, he was coughing up blood, overdosed on insomnia medication, and constantly had me studying so he could get me into a prestigious middle school. After his death, I enrolled in the middle school he wanted, but I could no longer go to school, so I transferred to a public middle school.

In Japan, getting into a prestigious school is very important. My uncle is an employee of my father's hospital and I has a cousin who is close to my age. My uncle and his wife and my father were very close. I don't think I got used to being part of their family. | Thank you!

I agree with you that covid is a reason to exclude Asians. I also really agree with your feeling that Asians, including me, should not be discriminated against.

I've been isolated at home for 4 year being ""homeschooled"" but that consists of me sitting on my ass being a fucking degenerate, playing video games, jerking off and smoking. Nothing feels real anymore, everything feels flat and foggy.

I have no social life outside my family because I've been a weird asshole and ghosted everybody in my life, even when they've tried reaching out to me. Talking to people is hard and taking care of myself has been a struggle my whole life, my teeth have decayed so much that I look like a crackhead and can't find dental work because nobody accepts the freeloaders state healthcare.

Therapy and meds started about 4 months ago with 30 min sessions every two weeks and having my mother drive me 3 hours into the city to see a psychiatrist for another 30 min appointment. It's helped a little, but not enough to feel a change for the better. I have one more appointment before I turn 18 and my Healthcare is over.

My mom and stepfather are getting sick of me being a useless peice of garbage and are forcing me to find work, or they will find it for me. All I ever hear is people complain how fucking awful life is and how shitty it is having to work. The thought having to commit the rest of my fucking life to someone elses time, just to make a shitty wage that will barely keep me alive is terrifying and stresses me out. Having to find a house and keeping a car intact with all of the paperwork, insurance and other bullshit scares the fuck out of me, I can't handle that much shit.

u/NoReserve206,180,"Ending it after graduation In about six weeks I‚Äôm going to graduate from college. Big university. Bullshit business degree. No leads on a job and no particular interest in verbally fellating some douchebag so I can get the ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù to spend 30 years in an office wishing for death. I just turned 29, I still live with my mother, and there is nothing left that gives me joy.

For years, I‚Äôve struggled to find a path. Community college, then university. Joyless. Worked in aerospace, in manufacturing, in offices and in the field. Burnt out every time. I don‚Äôt have the mental tools to be a real adult, either in a professional or interpersonal sense. I‚Äôm bad at making and maintaining friendships, and haven‚Äôt ever had a true romantic relationship.

When I was 5, I wound up in a psychiatrist‚Äôs office because I was having suicidal thoughts. When I was 16, I tried to jump off a bridge but lost my nerve. The only thing stopping me then was love for my parents. I am their only child, and if I died it would destroy them. So I kept on going, and over time the color kept draining from my world. At some point during covid, I just stopped thinking about the future. I can‚Äôt imagine a realistic pathway to happiness, just different ways to experience stress and loneliness. But I can‚Äôt leave my folks alone, what kind of monster would that make me? Does wanting to die mean that I don‚Äôt love them?

Then I had an epiphany: They did this to me.

They love me, and I love them. They weren‚Äôt abusive in any way. They gave me all the resources and attention I could ever have needed. But thirty years ago, they made a decision for selfish reasons. They wanted a baby. They struggled to get pregnant and bought all the baby gear and picked out a name. They went through all that and they never bothered to ask if I wanted to be here. They didn‚Äôt give me a choice, so I don‚Äôt owe them my existence. When a dog is in pain and living a joyless life, you put that dog down. You don‚Äôt force it to live in agony just because losing your pet would be too painful. I have, effectively, been a yuppie couple‚Äôs pet my entire life. I can‚Äôt feed or take care of myself independently. I have no purpose besides their happiness.

In six weeks, I‚Äôm going to walk across the stage and accept my degree. The final boss of my elongated childhood. The thing that middle class boys and girls must do to prove they belong in the club of adults. I‚Äôm going to smile for the pictures and listen to the speeches about all the places this piece of paper can take me.

Then I‚Äôm going to drive into the woods and eat a gun.",u/NoReserve206,1,"Holy shit, was NOT expecting this level of response! Y‚Äôall really brightened my day up with so many kind, insightful comments. Turns out when we aren‚Äôt slaughtering each other or stealing each other‚Äôs stuff, humans can be pretty great.

I can‚Äôt offer anyone a promise to stick around; that's a super selfish idea, but in the end it's my life. You‚Äôve given me some stuff to chew on for the next six weeks while finishing up school, though. This obviously isn‚Äôt something I can really talk about with people I know IRL, so being able to scream into the void on here and get feedback like this is really impactful. 

Thanks | That‚Äôs actually a great question. Someone once told me ‚ÄúInstead of committing suicide, you can always just change your name and move to Denver‚Äù. Lol. The serious answer is that, by any objective standard, my life is pretty damn cushy. There really isn‚Äôt any scenario where things would be easier than they are right now, so any ‚Äúrun away‚Äù idea would in practice just make my life a lot more miserable. And I‚Äôm already pretty miserable.

For me, the control aspect of suicide is also attractive. Even though I didn‚Äôt chose to be here and don‚Äôt get to control so many things about the world I inhabit, I can reclaim control of my life by choosing to end it. (Please don‚Äôt take that as approval of your suicidal thoughts, just an affirmation that the control rationale also informs mine.) | There are a lot of things wrong with my brain that make it very difficult to work: social anxiety so I‚Äôm always in fight or flight while onsite, executive dysfunction that makes staying organized really hard (and also makes me SUCK in the kitchen). I tend to burn out super quickly and then have to take time off, but that‚Äôs not really sustainable over the long term so I make a lousy employee.

Bottom line, were it not for being able to leech of my parents I would probably be homeless. | I‚Äôll write a follow up closer to the deadline. | Mostly I‚Äôm just screaming into the void, I honestly didn‚Äôt think anyone would read this. It‚Äôs cathartic to be able to talk about it anonymously, though. I‚Äôve got some friends in the real world, but it‚Äôs a pretty big jump from ‚ÄúYo, did you do the reading yet?‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm seriously thinking about killing myself next month.‚Äù If I chicken out, I don‚Äôt want to face them. Besides, what kind of asshole drops that in someone‚Äôs lap? If I told my therapist all the details in this post, I‚Äôd wind up in a padded cell. Telling my parents would be absurdly cruel either way; if I go through with it they‚Äôve been robbed of the last few weeks of normal, if I chicken out they‚Äôve been traumatized for no reason. The guilt argument may not be enough to get me to stay, but there‚Äôs no reason to needlessly torture them.

Connection clearly is not my strong suit, even with people I‚Äôm supposed to be close with. | Weirdly enough, my favorite class in college was an English course! It was fun and I think I produced an ok body of work, but words sadly are neither edible nor accepted as legal tender. | It‚Äôs incredibly selfish, yeah. But that‚Äôs just it, they COULDN‚ÄôT have asked my permission before creating me, and they were willing to accept that as part of the equation. Whatever the outcome, they own it. The pottery barn rule applies here‚Äîyou break it, you buy it. They could have had a kid with a profound developmental disability (they were in their 40s, so that was a real risk). They were clearly ok with that. They could have had a kid with some horrifying deformity who only lived for a few minutes. They were clearly ok with that, too. Instead they got me, a kid whose brain can‚Äôt produce the right combination of chemicals to ever feel happy. And they were‚Äîand are‚Äîok with that.

Or they can start out the same and then add a little more to it. ‚ÄúLife sucks but you‚Äôll come out of it stronger.‚Äù It‚Äôs definitely a valuable lesson but these people also need to realize that everyday can‚Äôt be another fucking lesson for me to learn to make me tougher. If I kill myself then what would that mean? I wasn‚Äôt strong enough? That I didn‚Äôt learn a thing? I‚Äôve been high functioning for a while now. I‚Äôm tired and if I crash hard then there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm ‚Äúweak‚Äù or ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt learn.‚Äù Something wasn‚Äôt giving in my life despite my efforts. That‚Äôs what it means 

‚ÄúLife sucks‚Äù is not how it works. Life is indifferent and it feels unfair but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt deserve having peace of mind. Give me a fucking break. I‚Äôve worked hard but life doesn‚Äôt owe me anything and so my efforts are invalidated. How the fuck is that okay? It isn‚Äôt. | Feels like faking it is depended on luck and being at the right place at the right time. It‚Äôs about knowing the right people and meeting them is by coincidence and hoping they have the time of day for you. People say you have to work towards what you want but they also ignore that hidden element of life 

They don‚Äôt think about people  like us where we try but it doesn‚Äôt work out. It didn‚Äôt work out. 
Yeah there can be underlying reasons and self-sabotage but there are so many that have done so much right and nothing. It seems like that situation never gets mentioned even though it‚Äôs common | I‚Äôve got to live with it. I‚Äôm not hiding my head or explaining myself anymore. Although I‚Äôm still fearful to show up to my usual social functions because I‚Äôm so tired of the same interaction about my new haircut to those who haven‚Äôt seen it yet. 
Bad haircuts suck. I‚Äôve always been self conscious about my hair and my dreams about it haven‚Äôt been pleasant.
It will grow back and it is just hair but it matters alot to me so saying it‚Äôs ‚Äújust hair‚Äù isn‚Äôt true from my perspective.

The problem is that my life on paper is practically perfect. I have a loving family, no issues with poverty and used to have a good social life. I had hobbies, aspirations, dreams and the resolve to work for them.

Idk what happened. My happiness just phased away. It became harder and harder to go out. The feeling of everything being pointless grew as my motivation and intrigue for life dissipated.

This past year I've mostly spent in my bed. Too tired to even watch TV. Most of the time I just lay here. Waiting for nothing.

u/Organic-Answer496,94,"I was making 100k as an engineer now I‚Äôm a broke uber driver Hey guys, I'm feeling pretty down right now and could use a pick me up. It's been a rough day of driving uber and just thinking about how I screwed up my life. I'm 28, and I currently have about 2k in savings. I drive Uber and do part time sales for a gym. I live in a house with 7 other people I barely know. When I was 24, I had about 50k in savings and was working at a big time bank as a software engineer making a little over 100k a year. I used to live in a penthouse apartment with 2 close roommates. But after the pandemic, I felt unfulfilled by the work and quit my job to pursue my passions. I ended up going down a rabbit hole of business ventures that ended up draining all my money and getting 12k of credit card debt. Very stupid I know. I did pull off some cool stuff and learned I have a passion for sales and marketing but for the most part Ive been feeling lost ever since and the only things that keep me going is working out and training MMA, which is how I ended up doing sales at a gym. The job market is really bad for software engineers and even then, I'm not 100% sure if I want to return to the profession as it still feels unfulfilling. Sales is fun for me but it's not enough shifts so I have to Uber to pay the rest of my bills. Because of that, this whole day I've been driving around professionals going in and out of their jobs and just been feeling like a failure all day. I plan on finding more sales work but currently I'm barely making ends meet to pay my bills and honestly feel like I have no value. I get really down thinking I may never have what I once had or find even a comfortable place financially. And it makes me feel stupider for doing what I did. I know 28 is young but the idea that I'll soon be 30 and be still struggling financially scares and depresses me. ",u/Organic-Answer496,13,"You‚Äôre absolutely right about early success and about letting go of the past.

He told me that he had a reason why he did that And he wanted to explain to me.
He told me that for some time he had relapsed into depression and that he was missing college classes for a couple of weeks, and that he didn't want to tell me anything because he was embarrassed of having depression and missing class.
He didn't want me to see him differently because of that problem and that he wasn't good with himself these last few months.

I told him that I was not going to judge him for anything, that I was going to help him to find professional help and try to overcome all of this, but I honestly don't know what to do. What happened that day still hurts me.
And I really don't know to what extent I can trust him, which is obviously what I would like.

 He told me all day that he was in class and that he was coming home, and that he had gotten off the train stop. And of course, there I discovered that he was lying to me because I was waiting for him in that same place.
He was actually at home, because he hadn't gone to class.

So two months into my therapy and my therapist asked me what my goals are, i said getting over my health anxiety and stayin fit.

Anyway she followed that up later with me needing to stick to a schedule even if its 30 minutes of work per day blahblah.

And she was okay with that. 
Maybe she tried to do the kick in the ass thing, im not sure, im thinking of asking her next time and being honest about how it made me feel. | Man idk she was okay until now | I dont know either, im really confused.

And i did approach it in that way at first, but then my feelings got the best of me and i started feeling shitty lol:( | Shes been ok and helpful, she even helped me after these comments on me... but i couldnt move past them so idk what to think rn | Ahhhhhhh yeah okay i get it. You're right. Thanks:) | Idk if she was trying to insult me or smthin cos shes helpful and did give me suggestions later and called me 'sweet and talented' so idk | Tbh i did consider that she didn't use it correctly. By giving me an easy schedule part i meant she was helpful anyway and is considerate, its just that the tone she spoke to me with seemed harsh and kind of out of nowhere, thats why i was considering maybe its me being over sensitive about it | Yeah i suffer frim both of those things. It was the truth, and i most probably didnt wanna hear it. I understand not changing my day to day life, but i siuffer from extreme ptsd and health anxiety and it's impossible for me to get anything done if my mood becomed even slightly negative.

I'll weigh the pros and cons | Im just so depressed, im almost 28 now and my life is going nowhere, so i thought I'd take therapy. She was good until now, idk what shes trying to do here | Yeah, that makes sense | Ah yes it is possible that she was trying to motivate me.

You don't sound ungrateful, you ARE going through multiple very hard things right now, I feel you. 

Let yourself grieve. You don't need to compare your situation to anyone else's, it won't do good to anyone.

It's a rare thing to find an employer with any loyalty these days.

I truly wish you the best. | The 20s can be really hard. Just take a little step at a time toward where you want to be and take care of yourself. | Thank you so much. | That's so kind of you. | Thanks, Ditmas. It's very interesting what your therapist said. | That's so sweet of you. | I'm so sorry. I hope you get to feel better. | I so hope things get better. You're so young - there are still so many chances for happier times. Hug. | Thank  you, I do have a therapist. I just think it's not enough to make up for the hundreds and hundreds of days of loneliness. | Thank you. | Why is he putting that on you? | I've heard that. 

Right now I'm overwhelmed just going to the market. Hard to imagine doing that alone. | Thank you so much. | Twenties can be hard, I remember. Do you have a good support system? | Thank you, that's very nice of you to say. | Thank you, that's really kind of you. | I will think about it,  thanks1 | Sometimes advice, but really the kindness of people. (I sound like Blanch DuBois!) | No. I wish I had most of the time.

Of course, I would have wanted them to like and love me, and that doesn't always happen. | It's something to think about.  
I agree about helping | I used to love to read. I don't really have time or the mental energy these days. And chess is way beyond me. (I'm more checkers although that's too simple.) Please, feel free to PM me here> | That's so sweet. | You're a kind soul. | I'm very tired. I had more energy when I was young. | Copywriting. Some other editorial stuff. | By who, though? | I do have a cat and thank you for the wishes. | I hope you get to avoid it! | I stay where I am largely because it has great public transportation so I won't have to bother people for rides to doctors appointments. Plus I don't pay heat and I'm in the northeast, so that's a big savings. | I hope yours is better! | That's okay, and I hope you end up in a much better situation. | I just feel like I should have done much better. | Thank you for your kind words. | I hope that for you, too.

  
Is anyone helping you? If not, can you get any services. What about the federal program that pays caregivers? 

  
I'm so sorry you're in this. I know how stressful and lonely it is. | Thank you for the hugs! I've actually done both in the past and hope to do it again once I start taking Social Security. | You sound like a lovely person! Hold onto your path. | I hope it's a kinder country by the time you're my age.

  
I'm mostly doing copywriting. | I think it might be too overwhelming. | I hope you're not. | Thank you. I think it's this way for a lot of people, sadly.

You're a good soul. | Yes. Never quite as bad as this, I think, because now there's no time to turn it around. | Yes, the world has always been bleak for me. I grew up in a very bleak household. My father tried to kill himself when I was 20 and was a zombie thereafter. My mother was mentally ill. I had to take care of them and no one would help.

Is there another aspect you want to know about? I will gladly share.

I'm in terror 24/7 because I believe it will always be like this or worse. It's too late to change it. And I think the loneliness has changed my brain. | I was an anxious kid but after my father tried to kill himself, it's been in hyperdrive ever since. From what I've read, that's not uncommon in survivors. | I can't see it. | hug | You speak just fine. 

I get your feelings about (not) having kids. 

You're not a failure. How we are parented can make us or cripple us. | Your post from today isn't showing up for me to reply, but it came in an email.

You are so incredibly kind and lovely to ask what you did.

I'm pretty much the same. Workdays are hard.

How is your week going? | Where are you? | I hear you, blue eyes. That's a very hard deal.

I'm still going to hold out hope that life gets better for you. | You can help around the house, help with any kids. Everyone needs help sometimes. | I understand the reluctance to have children given your past trauma. Just take care of yourself. Are you seeing a trauma therapist?

  
Try not to make hard and fast decisions on the future now. You have a lot of time. Just be good to yourself and find a good therapist who you like. Have you gone no contact?

  
I'm rooting for you. | I'm so sorry.

I totally get the feeling of there's a different person you meant to be.

Sending hugs... | That's really kind of you. | A number of reasons, really.

  
1) I never got pregnant.

2) I was the sole caregiver of my sick elderly parents (no one would help) and that took up a good chunk of my childbearing years.

3) I suffered from depression a lot, likely from caregiving, and I didn't want a child to grow up with depressed parent like I did.

And 4) Money. I worried that I might not be able to consistently support them.

  
Thank you for asking. | I could do a poem maybe. | I wish. I just can't imagine the government giving up that kind of money. | sending you hugs | Either brain damage from his suicide attempt and/or very strong antipsychotic drugs he was put on..

As to your other question, I would have done a better job of taking care of myself, too. I was really overwhelmed and kind of in a stupor from it myself.

I was very close to my dad even with his problem and when he did that, I had no one in my corner. Everything changed overnight. | I'm so sorry society has put that on you.

Isolation is a horrible feeling. We're pack animals.

Sending some hugs. | NY | I kind of wish you wouldn't. Doing that cost me terribly. | They might feel good helping vs feeling awful if you die.

I understand how bad it is to feel like that, though. | That's lovely! Thank you for sending it! | I definitely agree.

I'm always glad I have a tree outside my window. | I was lucky because I got my apartment before rents in my town skyrocket. Plus it can never go up as they freeze it when you're sixty-two plus I don't pay heat. | They do have rent freeze for seniors where I live.",1f1bonq,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1f1bonq/70_and_finished/

And I have been suicidal since my 12yo. I tried so many things, at the beginning I thought I was just lazy, after a while I thought I was just strange and different, now I know it's depression, and I tried everything, from Catholicism to Buddhism, from drugs to lots of sports, from therapy to meds. I tried reading about, searching for something. Anything, that could explain why I can't be normal.
I at a low point again, and during all these years I always thought. ""It's okay, If it gets too much I can just go"". Thing is, it always is too much, I'm always stretched thin, I never had energy enough to finish anything, from college to any work project.
At this moment, while I write this, I'm still trying to find something, anything that would make this life worth it. I can't find it. I can't find it and it's just horrible. Because even so, even being a disgrace to my family, not being able to maintain any relationships, not being able to care for myself, behind dependent of my parents, not being able to be a normal, functional adult, I can't find courage enough to finish it.

u/ScaryChemical4122,92,"Has depression done irreparable damage to your body, too? Many people talk about how it fucks up your brain, and this is very true and comes in different ways. But I wonder if someone else have been dealing with something physical ‚Äî anything, that has happened because of depression.

My case? I am a 20 year old and I already have some teeth to remove. Have been dealing with this disease since I was around 13/14. My parents neglected my dental health a lot when I was a kid. ""Tooth pain? take some pills""; never taught me how to floss; didn't brought up the brush your teeth 3 times a day; was never taken to a dentist until I was an adult and paid for it myself.
All of this happened, but what also happened, was me dissociating on the floor of my bedroom, all alone, crying until throwing up. Not getting up to eat, to drink water. All I did was listen to music, talk to my ‚Äî at the time best friend and partner, the only person I've had that took me years to realize that was abusing me. I was a child, all I had was someone who tortured me and terrorized me physically and emotionally. Of course I did not gave a shit about my teeth.

A litte background for venting reasons but also to tell you that I have never expected to live this long, that's why my teeth have suffered so much. I just didn't cared, thought it would be a waste of money, because I would (and still think I will) eventually kill myself. Hell, I don't see myself turning 30. My life is a bit more put up together, but I still have days where I just feel like it's all pointless and all that. And now that I am finally realizing how much I've fucked it up with my hygiene, it just makes me more depressed. I am having nightmares about it. Too expensive to deal with all of the caries and teeth removal at once, you know? I am keeping up the best I can: flossing 2x day, brushing 3x day, avoiding too much sugar, eating better. But it still haunts me, and I feel like I should just give up.

I am sharing and asking the question on the title to know: is there someone else dealing with something similar? Has depression done something to your body? Could be your teeth, or just something else. Anything counts! I know some people do self harm and since the deep cuts leave scars, those counts too. In fact, this is another thing that depression did to my body: I have self harm scars that'll never go away, that'll have to hide sometimes, but I have come in terms with them and accepted them.

I don't expect answers to be honest, but even if you read until here and decided to not leave a comment, I am so greatful for reading a bit of me. I have never shared this to anybody else due to people's judgments. Thank you.",u/ScaryChemical4122,2,"Thank you so much for writing this!

What fun it is to constantly have the urge to do the opposite of what would help | I want to read and reply more but I‚Äôm gonna be late. Hope you‚Äôre all having a better day than yesterday | It‚Äôs a tricky one, I‚Äôm terrible reading for the ‚ÄúAITA‚Äù posts and the comments and pretty consistently nuclear option or mostly one sided. I think whenever I post I ramble on so much trying to provide all the context and it‚Äôs surprisingly difficult to actually capture how something played out.

Wishing you more good days | Same and ironically this one‚Äôs probably doing better than all of mine combined haha | Maybe just have fun with it if you think you won‚Äôt get much traction anyway.

Like intelligence is only worth while up until you start thinking a little too much then it doesn‚Äôt matter how well your needs are taken care of, hate not being able to logic out of depression | Think part of the reason I delete as well is if someone I knew came across it, feel like there‚Äôs a lot to hide. Freaks together? | Much appreciated! Honestly it‚Äôs all probably quite dull and a little lame to whinge about haha | Thansk everyone for replying, I didn't expect this much. I'm usually lucky to get one up vote. Nice to feel a little less alone so I appreciate you all taking the time. I suspect you're all here for similar experiences and my heart goes out to you, I hope you see brighter days soon. | On my good days I can realise that and think it through logically. But on the bad days... its just being told over and over to do something like speak to someone without ever actually getting to speak to whoever that someone is. I think its the false hope i struggle with. I lost my brother to alcoholism recently and broke down crying once because I'd phone one service after another, each gave me another number to call until I was right back where I started. Everyone kept telling me there was all this help out there, but pinning it down seemed impossible. | This exactly. I know there's a limit, I'm somewhat open for the sake of tackling the mental health stigma etc but I'll imply more than tell when I think it's potentially triggering for others and its just a glimpse, downplayed a LOT. But there are friends who I've had for years. Most people found out about my hospitalisations months / years  afterwards. So not only did I go through it alone, I had the confusion afterwards of people saying ""if only you'd opened up before it got that bad"" but going completely quiet if I did creep into over sharing territory. One friend in particular, will push me to open up before disappearing as I pour my heart out, lesson learnt. Fair enough they don't know what to say, but don't offer it as if I did something wrong by not having a conversation they were never prepared to have. Its the implication that I'm not trying hard enough to fix myself because it's as simple as a chat, when that's a two way interaction. I've started thinking I was misdiagnosed and I'm misreading social cues or taking things too literally, who knows. | I'm trying to make better habits, started reading atomic habits etc. I know it's like physio therapy in a way, keep working on it and building on it. But I feel like weeks of progress is so quickly undone it's disheartening. I think I'm just wired wrong | This was kind of my point. Everyone thinks its as simple as just going out into the world and having a conversation like therapy fixes everything. It's daunting to start over. I've been to psychologists, pshychiatrists, GPs, uni counsellors, art therapists. Tried CBT, DBT, EMDR. CBT did help at first. Medication made everything worse, to the point of hospitalisation. I moved back home and it took 3 attempts to get a prescription because they wouldnt believe I was prescribed that amount / combination. Had a paramedic ask me to just admit I made it up for attention to save myself some tests. I've had a GP call me stupid. I've confided in a lecturer when I first started seeing a doctor only for them to turn around and say ""we've all got sh!t to deal with just get on with it "" when I missed some classes struggling with serotonin syndrome. My grandmother had schizophrenia and she was spent her life sedated and my mother said she'd been through enough so if I was ever diagnosed she'd never visit. I've had help lines tell me I was stopping someone in more need than me getting through because I wasn't actively making an attempt in that moment. Most services have huge waiting lists, and you're limited to 6/8 sessions in my country. You can go private, which I've tried twice, but they just seem to string you along for the money without much progress to show for it. Believe me I have tried, but I can't even pay people to listen. | I think this is part of what I struggle with. If I can tell someone is struggling, I cannot leave them just sit and stew. I always try to make people feel like they can confide in me because I know what it's like to have no one. I listen, ask enough of a follow up question to give them the chance to elaborate if they want to but without prying on specifics. I've signed up to volunteer in work to be a wellbeing champion, got some basic training, I want to be there for others, I want to be a listener not a dismisser. But I can't seem to get the same in return without feeling like I'm taking them hostage, so I'm learning to stop seeking that out. | I wish you many more good days. There's nothing more frustrating than knowing what's logical whist feeling the complete opposite | I guess the difficulty with depression is figuring out what the point is when just getting out of bed is a challenge. If all I have to look forward to is this cycle over and over, I'm not sure I have the strength. But I'm going to look at the positives today, random people I've never met before are taking the time to give advice.

Edit: I fell asleep shortly after making this post, and unfortunately I woke up. I ended up self harming, and I just feel worse.

I truly hope that‚Äôs not true. I truly hope that we‚Äôre just animals who will die and that will be that.

If someone said looked or sounded like a boy I‚Äôd get all happy inside and brag about it to all my friends and family. My mom said I threw a tantrum anytime anyone gave me anything pink from the age of 4+ or we had to go shopping in the women‚Äôs section.
More recently my friends would start treating me like a guy and making jokes about me having a ‚Äúdick‚Äù and basically being a man at this point.

Since then people have told me it's pretty weep inducing for even those without depression as it deals with generational issues that tug on heart strings for all.

But thank you for your response, makes me feel very seen. | Some truth in that for sure | When I was going through my divorce one thing a therapist showed me that helped me was in the research, people's reaction to divorce is most analogous to bereavement. It makes sense, here is a large part of your life and person you could access readily and now you can't access them at all. I didn't want to reply this to one of the widower 's comments, because not really the issue he is dealing with and could justly be seen as trying to lessen his pain in a situation I don't know first hand. But that tidbit helped me so much I try to share at every opportunity. | I don't know this pain. But my brother who was my best friends dies at 43 and I divorced at 40 finding myself single parent. No a ""pain-off' or competition (a competition I would lose, or is that a win?) Just to say I honor your grief. I know what hurt me most is when some tried the ""buck up"" approach. ""You have to move on"" Hoping an internet stranger acknowledging how real this is means the tiniest something.

How is your support system? Friends and family around to help out? Are you getting/able to get therapy? | *this | I didn't feel you lessened my pain in anyway. Everything I said because I worried I might be trumping your pain.

At first, your words about her family being local because I was thinking of my divorce. But then remembered her family has no reason to dislike you. All families are different, and could be legit reasons to stay away. But her family probably still wants to know your son. Before you dismiss the suggestion, I would ask you really examine it. Know symptom or depression is assumptions about others wanting to know you are being there for you. Even if they don't end up being emotional support, I hope they can at least be some logistical support with child care. Maybe Grandparents/Aunt or Uncles/ cousins want to know you child and could give you a little respite know and then, or better want a relationship with you. You are a tie to someone they lost as well and may relish the opportunity | How you feeling today? Thought about you since your comment. I hope you have someone other than an internet busybody checking in on you, but wanted check in any way.",1djpjb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1djpjb0/happy_things_make_you_sad/
u/Strange-nickname,380,"I just ""attempted"" suicide. Sorry for the weird words/grammar. English is not my first language and I'm also a bit drunk.

20 minutes ago I took a very large dose of sedatives and sleeping pills with a good portion of alchocol.
I thought I would finally end it, my suffering. But now I'm sitting here and I realize that I'm not going to die from this dose. My final note is lying under my pillow as I realise I won't need it. I feel nauseous, dizzy and my heart aches a bit but I'm not going to die. I'm gonna live. I don't know if that makes me feel better or sadder... I'm sorry.

I met her when I was 23, we were only together for 5 months, and she was cheating on me with 4 different guys. She had to dump me because I'm so pathetically desperate for anyone to care about me, I want them to stay even when they've made it obvious they completely fucking hate me. I knew it would never work between us, and she would never respect me or care about how I feel, but I still wanted to pretend I had any sort of human connection. At the end of the day, her cheating was my fault. If I made her happy, she wouldn't have done it, and I never made her happy.

I found out she was cheated about 2 days after I got fired from my job. I bought a gun and was planning on killing myself, but checked into a mental hospital instead. I spent 2 weeks there, and all they did was tell me everything was my fault, and they kicked me out before I had shown any signs of improvement. They told me my insurance would cover 100% of the cost, but I just got a $1,700 bill a few days ago.

I live alone in an apartment that's only 237 square feet with my dog who is probably miserable there. I sometimes think about giving her away so it will be easier for me to kill myself. She's the last attachment I have to anything. I hate my entire family. I have no friends. None of my hobbies are enjoyable anymore. I have a shitty dead end job where I make barely enough to pay my rent. I will never be loved. I will never be happy again.

If your reading this I am so sorry that I've done this to you I just can't bare with this life anymore, none of you are at fault really. everyday is become repetitive even if i try change things up  school is making me so much worse I wish they could just understand me, there's so many people out there that hate me for no reason when I've never done anything to them. I'm sorry for being alive honestly I'm shocked I'm still here. I love you all I swear you guys are the reason I made it this far. i just feel so drained I don't feel like I'm gonna make it in life, clearly I wasn't made for this world anyway. everyone hates me for no reason they turned me into this when I haven't done shit to them. fuck I wanna be the old me so bad even if I still went thru bad times when I was younger I didn't feel as bad as this. I feel like no one truly loves me except my family. I'm so fucking ugly omd. I love summer but I hate the short clothes that come with it and my eczema gets so much more worse I feel like nothing can help it. I hate my fucking hands.

Note for mom (translate to romainian for her)
mom I love you so much you've always treated me so well every time something went wrong you were always there to comfort me, even if sometimes we argue we always turn fine in the end. this is not your fault at all you've done your best to help me. I love you so much and nothing would ever change that. I hope you recover from this and succeed in life. I'm sorry I'm dead I know you tried your best to get me help and I know your going to go through hard times when u read this (when I'm dead) school and people are too much for me to handle. I love you so much

Note to dad (translate)

Dad you were always there making jokes and making everyone laugh,I'm sorry I don't talk to you that much I really hope you can forgive me. I'm just too tired to go on living this life I don't even want. I'm so sorry and I love you so much. I hope you succeed in life

Note to isabella.

you were always there for me making me smile, everytime you knew I was sad you would always help me. thank you so much for being my sister your so awesome and you were always kind to me even if we argued we forgot about the arguement like 2 hours later and would go on walks. I'm so sorry one of your sisters is dead but I can't go on I've been trying for too long. you were such a big part of my life in the best way possible. thank you so much. I love you don't forget to stay strong make sure no one tells u nothing that make u feel down and If they do go sort them out because they are all insecure little bitches who are so bored with their life that they make someone else feel bad about their life because they just can't stand seeing someone happy, but honestly stay strong don't let this bring you down. i hope you succeed in life

Note to sister

You were nothing but funny and calm, everytime I was mad or sad you would always make me feel better, youd always argue for me with no hesitation, like I wrote about isabella, don't let this bring you down, you guys have eachother and that should help, please don't let me bring you down stay strong and tell rude people to fuck off because they aren't worth your precious time. I love you so much. i hope you succeed in life. you went through so much yet your still alive, your a true survivor. I'm so sorry I really hope you can recover from this I never meant to hurt anyone.

note to Zara 

I'm sorry for everything you've been through, I can't believe how much a person could understand me and I thought you should know that you mean so much to me and you should never feel bad because of someone. if anyone makes you feel down it's because their so depressed about their own life's that they try to bring someone down with them. honestly I feel like your the only person I can talk to without being scared that you would leak it. I'm so glad your still here and you got the help you needed, even if you have some bad times it's just a natural part of life, shit happens but you just gotta make it through to prove all them people wrong. ilysm and thank you for being here, I swear I tried my best.

Ur the sweetest soul I ever met and I love you so much your so beautiful don't let anyone tell you otherwise I'm sorry sometimes I don't have time to call sometimes but you still accept my apologies. your so sweet don't let anyone bring you down and if they do ignore them because they are all too insecure about themselves that they have to bring someone else down with them.

you were the best boyfriend I could ever imagine. you understood me really well even if we had some arguements we still talked it out and stayed together in the end.

I don't wanna live. I failed at life and I barely started it. everyone keeps ignoring the signs that I'm truly not okay. please stop looking the other way. look at me, look at what you fucking turned me into. don't start talking about my attitude when u made me get one. Can teachers actually try to understand people like me, when we stare into the abyss wtf do u think we're thinking? fucking playing games? no bruh, our mind is either fucking empty or too much. please kill me. I don't wanna live.

i wanna kms so bad rn, it's getting worse I can't help myself, schools making me feel so depressed all my friends are leaving me out even if I try include myself, I don't feel like I belong here. they always ignore what I say and I have to go by myself everywhere and they don't wanna walk me to the toilet because apparently I'm too ""bossy"" but I don't think I am. they my only friends I have other then my fr friends aqsa and omaima. sometimes I can't find them though so I'm stuck by myself or with my other ""friends"" we used to be the best friend group but now they only care about radiyah. I clearly don't mean much to them anymore. I wanna hang myself so bad rn but I don't want to leave my family, they are the only ones who understand me. I don't want my mom to cry neither my sisters or my dad or anyone else, I'm trying for them. I'm gonna try win this battle I've been fighting for years. I wanna selfharm so hard but I can't because I don't wanna get caught. they thought I'm better and they probably think I'm just making jokes out of school and taking the Mick out of them but I'm trying, this school is filled with awful people that don't care a single bit about what your feeling as long as they get popular or attention, I've been trying to hold myself together forever but I've been getting worse in school. I want to have a future but part of me thinks I won't make it that far. What has happened to me. I just wanna be normal. I miss the girl I was before school. please help me Im so ugly. I wanna slit my throat open. there's no end to the pain bruh. it's gonna continue until I die. life can come with ups and downs but it's been down for too long. why am I still living. why am I not hanging myself right now. please. I'm so sorry if I ruined anyone's life, I'm just a bitch that ruins people lives. I feel so bad for being annoying.I'm sorry for being alive but imma think of changing that soon. Hopefully some day I just jump off a bridge. people at school keep insulting me yet they expect me to ignore it when I'm so sensitive? JUST FUCKING LISTEN TO ME. STOP MAKING EXCUSES FOR MY EMOTIONS ACTING LIKE THEIR YOURS!? fuck. school has drained me so fucking much and I just wanna slit my wrists and bleed out. people keep telling me these feelings are temporary but they feel like an eternity. i should of been murdered the day I was born. I didn't mean to be annoying or anything. everyone just ignoring that I'm obviously not okay.  my phone dry asf even when it's not on dnd mode.
nobody ever understands me, please just kill me. I keep imagining myself dying soon anyway. I don't wanna hurt people. why do they always hurt me. I'm sorry for coming into your life, clearly I didn't belong there, I don't wanna see my mom cry or worry but I always end up making her worry. I'm such a bad child. my hearts so heavy

the cycle starts again in a few hours, I don't want to do this anymore, my WiFi always gets cut off at 11 now and it's so annoying because I can't go sleep before 11 even if I try force myself or even relax myself, I'm just gonna be stuck in an endless loop of my thoughts and this note, schools making me so depressed right now. my bffs have their own bffs that obviously mean so much more to them, my friendgroup cares about radiyah more then me now even though she just joined it, so much for inviting her in because she was being left out of her other friend group. now I'm the one getting left out. our trio was perfect until she joined and made it four people. three people now. they replaced me, I feel so empty bro. all I do is start arguements for no reason man. I wanna kill myself but I don't want people to feel bad.I can't stop crying my heart hurts. 3 year friendship gone down for a 3 month friendship. I feel so unloved. I love too hard man, I don't feel like anyone understands me. I saved someone like me though, she's getting the help she needs now. she said that she couldn't of done it without me and that makes me feel better but I still feel like shit. damn people really hate me huh. I love my family so much, I think they love me too. I enjoy playing with Isabella but at night when she leaves the thoughts just come back. I think I have depression. I can't go a day without thinking of killing myself. there is no end to the pain.
I hate school so much it's 6 hours of expericing hell. no one understands me there even though they all think they do. I wish someone understands me. is this world even real. the only thing getting me through life is music and my family. without them I woulda been dead rn. I keep trying to starve myself but I can't turn down food. I'm scared people won't like me because of my body and my hipdips. this world is shit. it's all gonna go down one day. I'm so happy our lives are temporary. people with perfect life's make me jealous.  why can't someone truly care for me. every night, every time I'm alone, every time it goes quiet, before I'm about to sleep all I can think about is ways to kill myself. I'm only 12. please stop my pain. I just want to have a fun happy life like the other people, I wanna be skinny,pretty, funny and all that. I feel so fucking ugly. I love my boyfriend even though I get obsessive over him he still calms me down and stays with me. he's someone other then my family that understands my feelings. I think he's the person that knows the most about my life.

I don't have anywhere to put my feelings except for this note. I don't think anyone understands how bad I've been getting. it's been like this for over 1 year, thinking about suicide everyday, selfharming, getting angry for no reason, I just want it to stop. I just wanna feel like a normal person. these teachers are making me feel like shit even when I'm trying my best. ""(name) what is this , this isn't enough"" clearly plastic surgery won't be enough for you. fuck. stop making me feel like this. I feel like a shadow everyone ignores. I lost all my friends. I hate my life, why does it have to be this hard. why can they have the perfect life and be happy after they destroyed mine. why aren't they getting karma. fucking dipshits. I just wanna cut myself untill I bleed out but it's not like I can because wtf am I gonna do if it doesn't work? go around walking looking like I'm some zebra? no thanks. fuck I just wanna kill myself. but I don't wanna leave my family behind me. they care about me so I don't know why I feel like this. I ordered stuff online for 10 quid so atleast I have something to look forward to. I barely made it through today, everyone's just messing about and talking to me like I'm some type of animal. I've done nothing wrong I don't understand why they keep doing this, they know how it makes me feel yet they keep fucking doing it. what are these heartless dogs doing in school ""this school will help you with bullying and mental health"" clearly fucking not because I'm getting bullied Infront of you and your choosing to ignore it. my eyes for school just fucking worsened I don't think I'm making it far in life. at this point not even music can help me get through lessons, I hate everyone here. please just stop hating me I don't know you. parents need to learn how to raise their children because clearly this world is going to shit.  I always end up setting a date for my death but I never go through with it because I'm such a pussy. I just wanna feel alive again. I fucking miss my old self when I didn't care how I looked, what people were saying to me. I just wanna escape this life.  no one will ever understand me even if they think they Do. no one knows me more then this note knows me. ""give me Ur phone"" ""no"" ""are u hiding something?"" yes this fucking note since everyone wanna be such a bitch to people who haven't even done shit. I just want someone to notice how unstable I am and not make fun of it. I miss how fresh cuts looked on my wrists but I can't do it  again because I'm in forced recovery. cutting my internet at 11pm isn't gonna do shit with me being late for school. it's my desire to die when I wake up making me late. ""Ur too young to feel like this it's just a phase"" clearly it fucking isn't because I've been in this phase for so long I feel like I'm never getting out.

7/3/24 11:04pm

I fucking hate school so much, I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone. all the teachers think they understand me and that I'm just a bad person but I swear I'm not. I'm not trying to be late or have an attitude i cant fucking help it. they texted my dad about how im being late too many times like wtf atleast I actually came to your lesson instead of not coming. ""wheres your homework"" idfk bro I was tryna kill myself the other night because of this shit hole. they all want me to do better but they don't understand that I'm trying. this world is so fucked up bro I feel so bad and stupid. I don't think I'm gonna make it far in life. I literally hate myself. I hate my thoughts. I hate my mind. why am I like this. I just wanna be happy please I've done nothing wrong. I wanna become the best version of me but obviously I can't. this life feels impossible. I already settled on my decision to kill myself soon. even if I don't want to I know its for the better to just leave my family alone, even if it will make them feel bad soon they will realise I was a problem. I walked home from school crying and atleast someone asked me if I was okay. this world is such a fucked up place. what did I do to deserve this. I seriously hate my life. I'm gonna kill myself but I just dont know when. no one understands me. their all fooled by the fake version of me that I put on. I'm nothing better then a freak. I just want to be a child again.

u/TAConcernParent,100,"Update: Concerned depressed son may be planning to end his life **Update 2.5 months later.**  Things generally seemed to be going better.  My wife and/or I were visiting with him almost every weekend and he and I had a couple of long talks that really helped him.  He was getting more engaged with his social circle and had concrete future plans, including some cosmetic surgery to help with confidence.

Then yesterday I got a call from a hospital - fortunately not badly hurt.  He apparently has been cutting a lot and a cut on his leg was bad enough to need stitches.  He went to an urgent care which triggered a mental health evaluation and now he's in a multi-day hold (we're in the US).  We're hoping this will be for the best.  We visited him yesterday and he was glad to see us, if embarrassed, and we'll be part of his discharge plan tomorrow (my wife will be staying with him short term).  If this goes well he'll get started on an IOP with intensive therapy and possibly some medication to help.  

Honestly, I was worried that although he was in a generally good steady state the root causes were not being addressed, and hope this will motivate him to make the necessary changes.

**Update 19 hours later**.  Good news.  THANK YOU to everyone who responded and offered their experiences and suggestions.  It has really, really helped.  I have or will upvote all comments received and although I haven't responded to everyone I did read them all and give them a lot of thought.

So he said that it really helped to have his feelings validated.  That what he was experiencing was real and that others are going through the same thing.  I think when he's talked about this in the past there has been a tendency to respond with ""it's not as bad as you think"" or otherwise dismiss what he feels.  Once that happened the discussion became a lot more two way.

Secondly, the suggestions of an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) seem to have hit the mark.  We've found several near where he lives, and with his job and insurance it should be no problem getting in.  We like this idea better than trying another therapist as it doesn't rely on a single patient-therapist relationship but instead there are a lot of tools the IOP can use to help people.

Any suggestions for how to help him find the best IOP for him are most welcome!

He's not ready to start any medicines just yet, but it's possible that may be one of the tools used in the IOP.

He's also started to make plans beyond next month - for example to attend an out of state event with external family.  To me that's huge.  And he's reversed the steps he took to prepare for ending his life in two weeks.

Once again, many thanks to the responders on this post!

**Original Post**.

See my profile for previous post.  Today he visited us at home and after discussion admitted that he had a specific plan to end his life on a specific day in a few weeks.  He was taking actions to make it easier on us.   He agreed that he won't do it at least through February, as he saw our (my wife and I) emotional reaction.

We're struggling to find any way to help him out of his depression and hoping someone can offer a suggestion that he'll respond to.   He feels that the depression is not from within himself but due to external factors he can't control.  Despite his success at work and the fact that people like and respect him - he's extremely polite and inoffensive - he struggles socially and feels people think negative thoughts about him, and he can cite some examples where people said ""all XXX are blah blah blah"" to support that.  He's tried therapy and has stopped that as he feels he has gotten as much as he can out of that.

I'm wondering if there might be some sort of Life Coach who specializes in social skills for male 20s people in STEM careers who have similar feelings.   But I'm sure most of the people who call themselves ""Life Coach"" wouldn't work for him.

I again suggested medication for depression as a temporary measure because he thinks the problem is external.  However, we have years of experience with someone very close to us who had similar thoughts, but when put on medication it reduced the depths of her depression and that gave her enough confidence and traction to resolve her chronic depression and eventually discontinue with the medication.  I think I may ask him to try it anyway just in case.

Suggestions welcome.  I think we may have only bought a bit more time.",u/TAConcernParent,15,"Thanks for the reply.  I will try your suggestion on medications.  And from previous experiences with other people close to us, I understand all too well the challenge of finding the right mix of pills.  He actually was on something maybe 10 years ago, which is probably a big reason why he doesn't want to go back on them now.

On the move in - my wife is suggesting spending some nights at his place.  He's about an hour away from us.  I think we may get him to agree to this on a trial basis. | I liked this suggestion, but his response is that he believes the cause is external and that medicine therefore cannot help.  I suggested that there may also be an internal cause, and maybe he'll think on that a while but so far no change. | Thank you for this and I'm really thinking about it.

I've been carefully guarding giving away too much personal information, but I have a personal experience from about 8 years ago that matches this exactly.  And in addition my son said the reason that he's not going ahead with his plans is that he realized the impact it would have on my wife.  We're going to keep emphasizing this point in any way we can. | Good to note.  Per another comment I've made here it's not in the cards right now, but in any event this would be done in a supervised fashion. | Thanks for your detailed response.

He tells us that he thinks it is entirely external, and your comment about ""an epidemic of lost young men not really being able to live up to the dreams, standards or ideals they have in mind for their lives because of general societal issues, and social isolation"" probably is a perfect description for what my son is facing.

Would a social skills resource be a good help?   What else tends to work best in these situations?> | I'll try to explain.

He believes the source of his depression is entirely external.  His almost completely lack of a social life, him having no confidence in social interactions except for the people he's close to, and so on.   He's tried therapy.  He's had a sibling introduce him to people and help try to build a friend group.  He hangs out with a few friends from work and college on occasion.

I'm trying to find something ... anything ... that can give him the confidence/ability to address the external factor that he believes is causing his depression | Thanks for your reply.  We're looking at IOP.  See main post for an update. | Thanks for your reply.  It really helped with our discussions.  We're looking at an IOP that would include a support group and also could use some of those other tools.  We do plan to spend a lot of time with him.   See main post for a full update. | Thanks for your reply.  See the main post for an update. | I'm so sorry you are going through that.  I have history before this with several people who were close to me who went through depression and know that inappropriate treatments and suggestions can be counter-productive.

Fortunately, in this case per my update to the post I think we are on a good track now. | Thanks for the response.  I've updated the main post.  Yes, he now feels that family is rallying around behind him after we validated his feelings.  And instead of Life Coach (that really was a desperate stab in the dark idea) we're looking at IOP.   I like the idea of Solution-Focused and will look for that. | Thanks.  He has been tested over the years. | Thanks for asking.  I'm holding off on a full update as not a lot has changed.  He's traveling out of state for a family event in a couple weeks so we think he won't do anything to himself before that.  And he indicated he was doing things with friends this past weekend (both days).  But we are keeping in close contact and pushing hard on starting an IOP.

We do not think the situation is settled.  Talking to various people in the psychology field we consider him still at high risk. | Thanks for your thoughts. | Well, he's not at the point we could legally do that, and I'm not certain that would help anyway.  But if it gets worse that may be our only option. | Very possibly he's on the autism spectrum, but if so very high functioning.  This is why we set him up for therapy when he lived with us and suggested it again after he moved out.  He did see a therapist for a couple years but has discontinued and although we said a different therapist with a different approach may help, he's not keen. | Thanks for the comments.  Unfortunately earlier in life I've been involved in a few similar situations with people close to me and in my experience forcing people into a facility is an extreme measure that can backfire.  So really a last resort. | Yes, if we could talk him into it. | Thanks - will be suggesting this evening. | Thanks for the comment.  As to your question, I wrote this for another comment:

""He believes the source of his depression is entirely external. His almost completely lack of a social life, him having no confidence in social interactions except for the people he's close to, and so on. He's tried therapy. He's had a sibling introduce him to people and help try to build a friend group. He hangs out with a few friends from work and college on occasion.""

This has actually been a topic of conversation trying to help him dating back to early college.  So the most obvious actions have been tried. | Thanks for your reply.  This sounds a lot like my son, and yes he is in a better place after discussions this weekend and we are looking for an IOP.  See main post for full update. | Thanks for the comment.

As I've noted elsewhere, we've had experience with others who were very close to us who spent time in mental health facilities and visited them.  One in particular had 2 long stays as an inpatient (4 months and then, 4 months later after another  failed attempt that left her in an ICU, 5 months in a specialized facility in a different state).  They were necessary and the second one in particular set her on the road to full recovery.  So I know such stays can yield positive results.

But that really is a last resort, IMHO.  In this case I think we have a right course of action.  He spoke to us last night and was in a really good place. He opened up to a friend who surprised him by saying he was going through the exact same thing and had a support group he is going to, and our son is being invited to that in addition to the other actions mentioned in the update. | Thanks for your reply.  It really helped with our discussions.  See main post for an update. | Thanks again for your thoughts.  We will definitely look into voluntary hospitalization options. | Thank you.  He's seems good for the last 2 days, we're keeping in close contact.",1acop15,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1acop15/update_concerned_depressed_son_may_be_planning_to/

u/TheRealGarbanzo,191,"I Think I Just Experienced How Dangerous Depression is and How Much Trouble I May Be in Last night, something happened. I took a walk to calm down and that's when I made a mistake.

I got high during this walk and went to the nearby train station to sit down for a while

Before I left I was having very bad thoughts. Thinking about how much easier things would be if I was just dead

An express Amtrak train was coming through the station. I didn't know it was an express train so I stood relatively close to the track (on the platform) so I could experience the train going by

The train that actually came, came by fast. It rumbled the ground, was loud. It honestly scared me as it flew past, the suction from the last few cars even moved me around slightly 

After this, I went to Wendy's and there I think I was able to uncover the real reason I feel the way I do. I have no direction in life. I feel like a failure already in my early 20s. I just dont see a future in which I'm happy

I'm sorry if this next part doesn't make sense
I'm trying to remember how I felt last night, laying down. I was scared, I never felt such a terror at the thought of what could be happening to me.

I felt like there's two different personalities in me and one of them is okay with dying and the other really isn't. And the one that really isn't okay with dying is being suppressed normally. But last night I think I felt it. The terror of knowing that there could be this thing inside me, alerting the way I think against my will. Making me think that suicide is the answer 

I'm not sure why I went to the station. I didn't have any intentions to do anything. But I wondered, ""what if I was feeling worse?"" If what I experienced isn't just from me being high, could whatever is making me think this way really win one day?

I know this didn't really make sense but I'm having trouble finding the words to describe what happened..

I just wanna ask, has any one you experienced something like this?",u/TheRealGarbanzo,32,"I'm glad you're still here | That does make sense | Sort of yeah. I was in control. But I can't help but feel like if I was in a worse state of mind. What would've happened

But it was unlike anything I've ever experienced before. It's like a part of me opened up that was previously locked away | Absolutely. Thats exactly how it feels | Hopefully. Although im afraid that it could really get worse and I won't even be able to snap out of it eventually | You're definitely not alone. You may feel alone in your suffering but you're not. Take comfort in knowing that others feel the way you do too. Hopefully we can all overcome this | Yeah.. I understand. It's hard being alone AND dealing with depression. It's honestly really cruel how loneliness and depression complement each other | If you play games.

u/TheSerpentLord,430,"Nothing hurts more than seeing people similar to you live the life you always wanted Honestly, nothing manages to shatter my mood quicker than this. 

Seeing someone with the same level of education (hell, sometimes even less), someone that faced similar financial issues, someone with similar hobbies, or someone with similar family problems. Hell, I remember once seeing someone on TV that even *looked* a lot like me, had a similar background, but ended up with a far more accomplished life. And, obviously, I'm also talking similar age range, too. 

Nothing hurts more than this, because it really displays how much of a lottery life is. *Ultimately,* this really showcases that no matter how fucked up you are, or how far behind you start, things *can* turn around. But, often times, the way they turn around is outside of your control. 

Parenting is the major factor, imo. Couple shit parents with a shitty situation, and your chances of making it drop exponentially. Things like the entourage you have, place of birth, year of birth, hell, pretty much anything to do with health, too... None of these are things ultimately within our control, but they're also crucial if you want to overcome certain issues. 

And seeing someone overcome problems similar to yours simply because, by chance, they had that one good friend, or that one good coach, or that one good *anything...* It's horrible. It's horrible because it's pure luck, and it shows you that, with even some minimal help, you could have really turned your life around, too. 

And then you look around, see the shithole excuse of a life you have, and can't help but think to yourself... 'damn, I didn't need one billion dollars, or superpowers...

Pretty sure everyone at work hates me so no trouble on that front. I don't think my family would care much either. I mean, what exactly do I bring to the table for my family? Self esteem issues and depressing thought. 

I've learned to power through my negative thoughts and make it to the end of the day, but I don't think I can keep it up much anymore. 

In short, I don't think anybody would care if I were to off myself anymore. Nobody cares about me now. What would change given the circumstances? Besides what utility do I serve? I'm pretty much useless at any task. I still have no idea what I want to do with my life because I have excelled at nothing I've tried in life.

I'm open to taking medication and being open-minded to explore another psychiatrist, just like you did. However, it's just so difficult. I went through four different therapists before finally finding someone who is okay. They're not great, but compared to the other three who sucked, they're decent. I'm afraid to end the therapy with this therapist because she's still okay. I went through two psychiatrists as well, and this third one is also solid.

The past few weeks have been really rough for me. I have never been as genuinely suicidal as I am right now. I‚Äôve always struggled with the motivation to get going and do things and be outgoing (I‚Äôm also just an introvert - social events usually drain me and that‚Äôs not a bad thing, it‚Äôs just who I am), but I don‚Äôt enjoy ANYTHING right now.

Aside from just being an introvert naturally, I‚Äôm also dealing with a lot of social anxiety and pressure right now. It‚Äôs overwhelming feeling like everyone expects something from me but I feel like I can hardly take care of myself. I‚Äôve had some interpersonal issues lately that have been hard for me to process. I feel anxious and fearful in most social interactions lately. I just feel like a monster and like no one truly likes me. 

My boyfriend and I have a little bit of an emotional discussion about it, he tells me he‚Äôs here for me and that I‚Äôm important to him and everything. 

Two days later we have a FIGHT because he and a friend planned something and it was apparently not as optional as he made it seem to me. We went out the night before with a bunch of people he knows that I have never met before and we had also done something that morning.  I tell him to go without me. 

We then have an argument about how he‚Äôs putting in all of the effort and I never want to do anything, all I want to do is sleep. He feels 
like he has to keep it together for both of us. 

All of these things are very valid and I feel really bad but I don‚Äôt feel like I can give anymore right now and it the timing feels poor and unfair. Don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre here for me when you‚Äôre clearly not.

I did tell my therapist that I was feeling suicidal due to my job but she fired me a month ago and I'm not sure I can reach out to her... | Thank you so much, I'm planning on making a doctor's appointment on Monday | Don't think so :( corporate doesn't care about its employees that much and I (very stupidly) never told anyone the actual reason when I was calling out, I just made up some new bs each time, so I feel like it wouldn't matter anyway | True but I never actually told anyone the real reason I was calling out so I probably don't have a case :( | My therapist was worried that our sessions costed too much and that it was causing me even more stress and anxiety. (She was right!) She gave me a list of therapists she recommended but they're all virtual and I prefer in-person, so my lovely brain has decided to not persue one yet, and now that I lost my insurance I'm not sure when I can. (I will as soon as I have insurance!)

That sounds so hard, I'm so glad you are here, thank you so much for staying alive! I've been hospitalized twice but now I can't go back, my parents adopted my siblings and I think it would crush them to see me hospitalized again, I want to appear strong for their sake.

That's extremely smart! I'm not scared of death or dying since I've done a ton of research and want to become a hospice nurse, but I think of the impact my absence will have on everyone around me and I know I can't go. One of my adopted sisters has already been hospitalized for SI and she really looks up to me.

u/XOneWithTheCrowsX,103,"Gonna blow through my car savings and then kill myself for real this time. I've been trying so hard lately to do better and become a better person, but I just can't anymore. My job is going to shit and I can't find anything else around my family's work schedule since I don't have a car and I rely on them for transportation so i can only work weekends since i have to babysit my little brother during the week while my family is at work.

 I've always wanted to travel and see a few of the national parks across the US and camp out under the stars during the summer so I'm gonna do that within the next few months, and then go deep into the forest and shoot myself once I run out of money. I don't know why I'm typing this out and maybe it's a cry for help, but I just wanted to get this out and maybe talk with someone for awhile before I go. 

I'm sure I could eventually find something else if something happens with my Job, but with the current job market and only being able to work weekends greatly limits me and I can't just sit around as a grown man again with no Job unable to continue bettering my situation and helping my family. If anyone can think of any recommendations for my situation, feel free to suggest them so I can weigh other options I may not realize while in this headspace.",u/XOneWithTheCrowsX,3,"Thanks for the suggestion!! That was kind of my original plan, but it's hard to save for a vehicle for myself when I'm only able to work 2 days a week due to my current living situation with family. Part of me wants to just say fuck it and live for myself and up and leave like that, but I  don't think I'd have it in me to screw over my mom like that honestly, but if it gets bad enough I'll make sure they're okay first before I go. | Thank you. I'm not sure what I'm doing yet, but if I lose my job and can't find something else soon I'm doing it. | Right, I always forget that being young is a huge plus when it comes to certain things. I will say that as I've grown into an adult though I notice people get stuck in cycles, and some don't ever break them. I don't wanna be that way I want to be free. I feel like a short but fulfilling adventurous life with lots of memories made in between would be better in hindsight and there's only one way to make that happen that I see. As far as my situation with my mom goes though it's pretty much non negotiable. I have to babysit my little brother since there's no dad in the picture while she's at work during the week, and I'd only be able to work weekends with 1-2 days during the week that vary each week and that would limit my options as far as jobs go greatly. I could possibly do nights though I'd have to see what's available and run that by her. I never thought of that tbh, but I'm desperate and willing to give it a shot at least If it comes down to it. | I've been trying my best at that. I've quit alcohol and nicotine 2 years ago and stopped weed back in August to save towards my goals quicker, but I feel like relapsing and I'd rather kill myself then go back to needing a habit to keep me going when I've gotta save all I can towards getting myself a vehicle. I work out 5 days a week and eat healthy and it's still not enough. I don't wanna have to do this, but I refuse to become who I used to be once again. | I've been on that path for a min and have gotten so much closer to what I want then ever. I'm gonna keep going though just to see where I get within the next year. | Thank you. I'll keep going and see what happens within this year since I'm pretty close to what I've been going after in this life, even though my head is trying to convince me otherwise. | Thank you. That's the plan with it all to find that spark in life again or make memories and live it up before I go. | Right I'll agree to an extent. I kinda wanna stick around just to see cause a lot has changed for me in the past year since I've been putting my best foot forward. | Thank you!! I'm gonna try and continue on and see where this year leads me. I've just been so stressed about these things as well as other stuff going on, like the economy cost of living etc. I have a few plans though for my future and stuff, but it's just getting hard and I feel my old ways calling back with addiction and I've been sober for awhile now and fought too hard to go back to who I was and I refuse to ever be that person again. | Thank you!! I'll keep you in mind cause I have nobody to talk too and get really lonely sometimes. I do think it's bs that we spend so much time on work and it leaves no room for the most part to enjoy actual life. That's one reason why I'm interested in vanlife that way I can work seasonal jobs or something and travel for a few months off my savings and just do that for awhile so I'd have more freedom. | No I don't even know you dude wtf?? | Oh no, I can't now. If I got this many haters, then I'm doing something right, so obviously, I'm better off than I thought. I think I'll keep trying instead and just magically make it all fall into place like I have been just to piss you and whoever else off as you watch from the shadows everything I've wanted to do in life happen and you and whoever else is involved become filled with rage. You can't stop it, but you can try. Only I can stop myself or keep going, and I'm gonna keep going just to piss you guys off. Have a good life buddy and tell the others I said to try harder :) | No fuck alcohol that shit is literal poison and has played a major factor in causing me to almost ruin my life. | Never heard of it but ill check it out and see. | I'm sorry to hear you're struggling as well. It seems like there's a lot of us though sadly, more than in recent years due to the current economy and job market mostly. Yeah you're kinda thinking the same thing it sounds like. I'm in Ohio as well and plan to visit a few places on the west coast then make my way up into Alaska for my final destination if I go through with it, but that won't be for a few months till summer cause I've gotta get some things in order first before I leave. If you'd like to chat, feel free to message me. | Thank you!! I'm not really book smart, but I work hard and I'm definitely not lazy. I dropped out of high school, so I've gotta get my GED once I get my car and then weigh my options. I'm considering doing something in the forestry industry or trucking industry. I don't plan on collage though since I'm not very book smart and my IQ isn't all that, but I'm not lazy so with enough hard work I think I'll make something work out for myself. I realize it's gonna get harder as you overcome certain battles in life and maybe that's what this is, but I didn't expect it to get this way, but I realize now I'm closer then I ever thought I'd get with my main goals right now so I think I'll at least give myself this year with my best foot forward and see where life takes me. thanks for your recommendations though I appreciate you really.",1atfiaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1atfiaw/gonna_blow_through_my_car_savings_and_then_kill/

u/admirableroof,165,"My husband is sinking I am so so broken right now. I feel like I‚Äôve lost my husband forever. 
Today my therapist said she believes that he has clinical depression (through secondary observation from what I tell her I‚Äôve been observing/going through). She had initially made a diagnosis of cyclothymia but from the episode he‚Äôs had since November, she thinks he‚Äôs slipped into depression sadly. Really struggling to think of how I can try to help him. He refused to see a psychiatrist despite agreeing with me that he does feel that he has cyclothymia when I first explained to him what she said. 
I hate how horrible he treats me when he‚Äôs down. I hate how irritable he becomes. We haven‚Äôt had sex in months either! There was a couple of weeks where he didn‚Äôt even want light on in the house (the house that we all live in together‚Ä¶ with a 3 year old). On the night of my birthday we had dinner out with my friends because I begged him since it was my birthday and she pulled me aside a few days later and said ‚Äúdoes your husband hate you? He didn‚Äôt have a single nice thing to say about you and you‚Äôre one of the kindest/nicest people I know! He only went on and on about what you do that annoys him and how badly you‚Äôre raising your child. Plus everything you don‚Äôt do for him. Not a single nice thing. He seems really selfish‚Äù
I so want to be there for him but this shit really weighs me down. He hasn‚Äôt been genuinely happy in months now. Since end of October. I feel really upset but way more than that I feel really sorry for him. And I‚Äôm worried if he‚Äôll even get better. I would love to tell him all the horrible things he‚Äôs done to me and how he‚Äôs made me feel but I don‚Äôt want to make the situation any worse than it already is.

Thank you so much.
This has actually worked in the past as suggested by my therapist. But it gets hard to do when you feel so rejected and unloved by their actions. I‚Äôm gonna try this and try to find a good time to try and talk him into getting help. Thanks again. | I get ya.

I am doing a lot to keep myself sane. I do stand up to him when he's being horrible, I don't just let him go by. I am in therapy every other week and have a really strong support system of family & close friends. I'm trying my best to look out for me. | Hey thanks for your comment. So he's definitely moody & unmotivated. He does not yell  but he tends to blame me for why he's upset. He's undiagnosed and is not aware that what he's experiencing is depression. So from what I can see and understand, he looks for reasons around him to explain why he's upset and most times, I'm the one around him so it lands on me. He mostly just shuts down when he's depressed and doesn't say much and this is what actually affects me the most because it feels like silent treatment. 

&#x200B;

Thankfully I am in therapy (for around a year now) and have a lot of support from friends and family (which he doesn't have sadly!). I take plenty of time for myself, I work and take really good care of our toddler (he does too! I was out of town for a week last week and he took excellent care of her - baths, bedtimes and dropped her off to school every day). I'm lucky to live in a country/community where raising a child with extended family & friends very closely involved is our culture. | This is so beautiful and thoughtful - thank you.

So our child is 3 and probably would not understand us talking to her about it just yet. I do try to step up quite a bit when he's down but he has this amazing ability to soften towards her even when he's down. 

I definitely will keep this in mind for when she's older. | Hey thanks for commenting. Firstly, my therapist obviously didn't give an official diagnosis. She has just said what she thinks he might have based on secondary observation from someone who spends literally nearly every minute with him. Most of the problems I've had over the past year or so have stemmed from him and how he's been treating me. 

I've been trying to put myself first. That's why I have stayed in therapy every 2 weeks the past year plus. I frequently take time away from home - most recently 2 weeks ago, i went out of town on my own for 4 days. And I have a really strong network of close friends and family that I rely on for support.

I totally agree that he is responsible for his own health, HOWEVER, I am his wife and it is in my best interest (and my daughter's) that he gets better and if there is something I can do to help, I 1000% will do it. 

I totally see where you're coming from and how your childhood colours your opinion. I'm so sorry you went through that.

I'm keeping my therapist close and will take all her advice to keep myself and my toddler safe. | I will not give up on him. Through sickness and health - I‚Äôm here. | But does it get better?

As I go from one appointment to the next, I can't help but feel that this is not what I want to do.  I'm mid 40s, a dude, and I'd be survived by no one if I just let it take over.  I'm not religious, and this almost feels like an escape hatch for a life I don't want to live anymore.  Things have been generally ok.  I have a handful of friends but at this age the friendships are acquaintances at best.  I feel that in my mid 40s I've matured enough and given life enough of a ""go"".  I don't particularly see a point in hanging around while working a career I hate for 30 more years just to find the insurance to keep me alive for a future that will probably be cut short anyway.  To me this seems logical to just give up.  I'm so burnt out at my job and don't have anything to really look forward to.  If I were a teen, 20 or 30 something it would probably be different because in those ages there is so much possibility and hope.  I'm just warn down and I don't want to fight this.

My mom was the best person for me.  I wish she was here.  In my depression, I think of her and the life she made for me.  She was not perfect, but she was close.  This was the only woman I ever loved. | We're separated by age and probably many other factors.  I suppose if I magically turned that young again I would enjoy my health.  I used to rock climbing, play hockey, swim, ski etc and I liked doing that.  I've had other injuries that slowed me down through the years.  One thing I would say to myself given the information is so cheap and available now I would learn.  The internet was terrible when I was growing up.  Now there are free lectures and courses you can take online.  Heck you could probably just get an idea of what your future should be by downloading the syllabus for a degree and getting a textbook from the library.  See if a particular field interests you. Try to learn from books and the web, and treat what you learn like a diet.  Cut out the fast food cheap stuff like social media that focuses your attention through emotion like outrage or sadness.  Have it as an occasional treat instead.  I think I'd also try to worry less but that is probably a genetic trait I have and an environment outcome.  One other thing I developed later in life was my social skills.  I probably was below the curve until I got to be about 30 or so.  If I was young again with the skills I have now socially I think life would have been much easier.  They got better for me by being lucky in the sense that I was around a few gifted people in that area and I I served how they behaved.  I suppose that's evidence that learning first hand is the best way for improvement sometimes. | Thank you for asking.  It is being treated and I have a history of it.  Everyone's experience is different, for me depression feels circumstantial.  These past few months I've been clocking 60 hours a week at work with the occasional 80 hours in a week.  I work for corporate America so this sort of culture is expected.  Mind you I only get paid the 40 hours since I'm salary.  It's a miserable existence.

I do know that people say this (I mean, cheat days are a thing for a reason). But, after the first couple of months I didn't really need one save for every couple months or so.

I always feel on the outside looking in, and my depression and anxiety made me have doormat personality traits for most of my life, thinking people would not like me inherently unless I made myself a complete doormat for them. I listen to others and be kind to them hoping that maybe some day I may be afforded the same treatment. But when you‚Äôre a doormat no one does that for you, obviously. I passed my teen years and up to my mid-20s now, with literally no one who even checks in on me. I‚Äôm happy for my friends because they all have really functional, full and happy lives. But it does make me sad that I‚Äôm not really part of it. 

Recently I‚Äôve had a very weird feeling of almost not feeling like I‚Äôm inside my body anymore. Like I can‚Äôt feel my body anymore when I get so sad? I‚Äôm very alone, and I‚Äôm just angry that depression moulds you into this person who cannot have the energy to put yourself out there, and even sometimes I feel put off by the thought of being around people, so of course I ended up alone.

We will keep fighting and keep trying. | I‚Äôm in my mid 20s and mine has been more of a sloooow painful decline of my mental health. Have you had therapy or treatment for it, and did it help you at all? | Yeah exactly.

I‚Äôm upbeat and joke around w people at work and ask them about their lives etc, that‚Äôs who I was before this illness got so bad.

From what I‚Äôve heard, it takes trialling a few meds to find one that works. I am not medicated but I do have therapy booked for the end of this month. So far all that helps me is being around people that love me. I keep hanging out with my mom after work, or my bf sometimes too.

So I‚Äôll keep staying alive to be able to feel that positivity whenever and wherever I can get it. Thanks for sharing what ur therapist said, and for ur words to me. We will keep going ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | No I live in my own place but near my mom, so yes I do rely on her a LOT for support. But it‚Äôs also tough on her seeing me when I‚Äôm at my lowest with this illness so I‚Äôm trying to be better for her. | I hope you‚Äôre doing ok today. Even though we feel like we have death living inside us it WON‚ÄôT win. | Yeah exactly. I have one meaningful relationship with my boyfriend but he‚Äôs also got his own illness too so it affects me negatively sometimes. But we‚Äôll get there. Just one day at a time | i get you. i really hope the numbness and lack of interest in stuff stops. it really makes this stupid disease far worse to live with just the endless upheaval of your mental state | I know. It‚Äôs the broad lack of understanding as well. Like I could never tell anyone except my mom this and have them understand. I did one small thing though like my weekly clean made me feel like no, I am a human being, and I‚Äôm not a ghost which is what this disease wasn‚Äôt me to think. It helped a tiny bit. Maybe we just go on doing things that help a tiny bit and one day the tiny bits will add up and it‚Äôll be gone üòîüòî | Me too my anxiety and social anxiety has generally got much worse the longer I‚Äôve had untreated depression. I never used to be unwilling to go among people or perturbed by the thought of being around them. ‚ÄúI hope you feel better‚Äù is sometimes all people can say unfortunately, they don‚Äôt have the capacity to really help üòî | Yeah. I can‚Äôt even smile. I forced myself to watch some Pok√©mon stuff yesterday because mentally I don‚Äôt find it taxing as it‚Äôs familiar and comfortable to me. I smiled a bit, so I know I‚Äôm gonna be dealing with this but I really tried to force myself. It‚Äôs horrible when your illness makes everything feel like a massive effort though, and makes you feel like you‚Äôre in a block of ice while the world keeps moving around you. | I can‚Äôt even sleep sometimes like it takes me ages to sleep. I‚Äôve recently tried valerian root which helps me get more REM. I like being logged out for a few hours. I used to feel it was wasteful and that I should be doing more with the life I was given but now I‚Äôm finding it harder and harder to care. | I understand. Anxiety and depression are the worst, we have to just keep trying to make a small effort every day. It‚Äôs exhausting. | Yeah it‚Äôs exactly like this. You try for a bit then the emptiness kicks in. What a fucking horrible disease I hate it so much | Yeah I have to force myself after hours and hours to go and get something to eat. I don‚Äôt have much of an appetite or crave any particular foods because I just do it to make sure I don‚Äôt waste away and die | tell me about it. it‚Äôs so annoying because i want to enjoy the book or whatever, but I lose focus or lose interest these days. fuck this disease | Gosh I‚Äôm so sorry. My mom has chronic fatigue and it‚Äôs so debilitating | I get you, I had the same yesterday. Meant to get on Pok√©mon SV for hours but just went to bed and scrolled. So many hours wasted it‚Äôs awful, when video games start to feel like work you know your depression is getting bad. I really hope you feel better tomorrow. | yeah i have exams, i do the CIMA qualification and im over halfway through but it makes me into a. complete machine. also the stability in my life has derailed as far as family and my partner. things are weird so it‚Äôs worse now ugh, i don‚Äôt get like this but lately it‚Äôs increased. and i have no choice but to just carry on so yeah, it‚Äôll take its toll | It‚Äôs ok, I understand how you feel. The hopelessness is the worst. But it‚Äôs just one test, it‚Äôs ok if you couldn‚Äôt do it. You aren‚Äôt to blame as depression is a horrible illness. I really hope things get a bit better for you and I really feel for you. | Definitely, you have to convince yourself to ignore it or defy it even for a bit.

u/bentreehorn,113,"Single man going through a midlife crisis and I‚Äôm ashamed of it. There‚Äôs so many people with way worse problems. I‚Äôm healthy (I think), financially stable, and safe. 

But I‚Äôm really lonely. I enjoyed being single in my 20s and 30s but now it‚Äôs different. Before I had hope. I had a few serious girlfriends and could meet people easily but now my looks have faded, and it‚Äôs been several years since I‚Äôve had any kind of girlfriend. 

I‚Äôm 43 and I truly think I‚Äôll be alone forever and it‚Äôs so depressing and terrifying. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll ever take my own life but every night I hope that I won‚Äôt wake up the next morning. I have almost no appetite and no longer find any joy in the things I used to love doing. I really just feel awful. ",u/bentreehorn,6,"Well perhaps I can offer you some hope and advice. 33 was absolutely the best year of my life. I had just gotten out of a long term relationship (which despite the nature of my current situation, I do not and have never regretted leaving) and had an amazingly fun year of casual relationships. In fact it was so good that when I was 34 and met a girl who did in fact become my girlfriend, when it came time to either settle down with her or go back to being single I chose the latter. That one I do regret. I heard a year or so ago that she was married now and expecting her first child. I was genuinely happy to hear that for her sake but the news did also make me feel bad about my own situation. | Honestly the shame part comes from a few different things. One is that it really is my own fault. I had opportunities over the years to be with good women and I decided to take the easy way out every time.

The second reason is even more embarrassing. I‚Äôm really upset about my looks fading, partly due to moderate, age appropriate hair loss. The thing about that is: my best friend in childhood went completely bald at the age of nineteen. It devastated him initially of course but he got over it, had a great life, and then fucking died of cancer in his thirties. My other good friend (the only real close friend I have in my hometown), is also bald. I don‚Äôt think he cares too much about it though. Partly because he‚Äôs not vain, and mostly because he‚Äôs busy working his ass off and taking care of his severely autistic daughter. | When I was single I used to honestly kind of look down on my married friends. And some of that was genuinely due to them having made genuinely poor choices in their partners. But now looking back on things I can think of several girls that I hooked up with over the years who were really good people who I probably should‚Äôve tried setting down with. | Yeah I suppose that the grass is always greener on the other side.

u/boztauruz,349,"I'm committing suicide (my suicide post that I'm posting in a few days) By the time you read this, I will be dead. I don't think anyone will be surprised that I finally did it. Maybe that's the worst part of it all. I have made people so worried, but they won't have be worried that it will happen- because it with certainty did. I'm tired of being in pain all of the time, and I'm tired of being so lonely. People tell me that I am not alone, but I have been alone for a long time. 

  I have loved and will miss everyone that I have ever had in my life, but I am not sorry that I did this. I hope you will understand, but no one has really understood me in the first place, so it wouldn't be the first time.

  The funniest part of it all- is that I deserve this. I wish things would have ended up differently, but there's got to be a reason why I failed. I'm tired of distracting myself with video games, music, or some other thing. I'm tired of having to talk myself off the edge every time I feel like killing myself. I am a terrible person. Don't feel sad for me, because it's either live a long life of feeling like shit or cutting it short. 

  My therapist told me that I should be nicer to myself and be curious about life, but I can't do it it anymore. I deserve suicide. My mental health has already caused pain for the ones that left, but mostly for the ones that stayed to see me slowing die. And don't even get me started on all of the hospital bills- and I don't even feel any better. 

The fact is I'm sick of watching everyone have fun with their friends, spending weekends having fun, complaining about stupid shit like guys that don't love them or tests being hard. I used to be like that, and the pain of losing it all it too much to bare. I don't want to live a life as the ghost of the person I used to be. I'm terrified of spending my 21st birthday alone. I would rather be dead.

Don't say you didn't see this coming, because if you didn't, then you truly didn't know me at all. Donate my body to science. Peace out.

With love

Edit: It's been a few days since I posted this. I'm thankful for all of the comments and DMs. To give an answer to a few questions, I am in therapy, did reaching out (as I hinted,  reaching out made me lose a lot of people and one person told me I was over sharing), and I am on meds. Nothing in life seems worth it or interesting to me. I sometimes feel okay, but it is overweighted by emptiness, loneliness, and depression. Today was my stepdad's birthday, and I didn't want to ruin his birthday with my death, but it has passed. I still think I'm going to do it. I picked the building, and now it's just a waiting game. Or maybe I will buy a gun.

Edit: 2 months have passed. I am doing a lot better. My birthday passed and it was a great amount of fun. I'm not perfectly mentally healthy, but we are starting to want to live again.

Edit: 3 months have passed. I graduated college!! I also started Prozac in addition to my other meds, and that was really helpful. I reconnected with one of my best friends from high school, and it has been really nice to talk to her. I also tried animal crossing, so that's been my hyperfixation. Overall, I am doing a lot better, but there are still some rough spots.

Edit: 4 months have passed. I guess I might do this as kind of a journal. It's been helping me out- coming back to it and reading it. It's crazy because I read what I wrote 4 months ago, and I feel like I don't know that person anymore. I understand who she is and how much pain she was in, but I feel so far removed from that and it's amazing. I don't want this to sound like a success story because I still have really hard days and nobody's success story is going to help. But I digress. I still struggle with self-harm but I don't feel suicidal everyday like I used to. I am really doing well because it's the summer but also I have plans with new friends that I made. We plan on going on a camping trip in a couple of weeks so I'm super excited about that. I was hyperfixated on Animal Crossing for a little bit but I found two horror games that I really really like. I'm applying to jobs. I still haven't found one, but I hope that I'll find one eventually. I also met this guy right after I posted my last update. He is really cool, and he lives far away, but I'm going to meet him at the end of this month. I'm super excited! I don't want to rush into anything though obviously because I still have a long way to go with my health. I have been doing better in therapy and it's been helping me a lot more than it has been in a couple of years. Anyways that's all I have for today.

Edit: 5 months have passed. Hey guys, it is time to give another update. Thank you everyone for the continued kind messages. And for those who commented cruel things, I hope the best fot you as well. I found a good job that I am going to start in a few weeks; I am going to be working with children with special needs. I am nervous, but I am also excited! I never saw myself working with kids, but this is not what I want to do long term. I really want to get my PhD; it is my dream. I lost that dream before all this... I want to make it a reality. I am still struggling with self harm and big emotions, but I am doing good. You know that guy I talked about? Well... he is going to be here today! I am so excited to meet him in person!

u/cadolantro,86,"So people avoid/ghost depressed people? Edit: Typo in subject. Should be: ""DO"" people avoid...

We have this lady in the office who is pleasant and professional. She's witty, friendly, and does her work well. But she has sad girl energy. 

Most people avoid her, but I see a lot of myself in her because I struggle with depression so I'm friendly and have lunch with her sometimes. She's funny, considerate, and smart as a whip. 

She doesn't openly talk about her depression but she does share she feels sad about certain circumstances in her life (sister passed away from cancer, chronic pain due to sciatica, and how she misses her parents who retired in another country.)

So why do people avoid her? She doesn't bother anybody or blab about anything negative. If anything, I suffer from major depressive disorder and ""self ideate"" 24/7 but I shut up about this because in my 30s, I found that everybody in my life dropped me so fast when I would show the slightest hint of emotional weakness. So maybe I'm writing this because I identify some of my traits in her.

So earnestly speaking, do people avoid depressed people even if the depressed person isn't vocal about it? Are they seen as a nuisance? Would really appreciate some constructive feedback. Thank you. ",u/cadolantro,22,"Really appreciate you sharing this. This is also why I can't stand it when I see those ""never a burden"" commercials about how depressed people should reach out for help.

I've always leaned into sad folks (who are genuinely trying to better themselves) to encourage them because I struggle so much myself. I just can't stand seeing the gossip and latent ridicule the office has toward this woman.

I'm likely projecting, but I hate it all the more because I know that would happen to me if I wasn't always working my ass off to pretend I'm a ""normal"" person. Thanks again. | Oh trust. And the people who tell you ""I will always be there for you. You're my friend. I love you"" are the FIRST to peace out. | But do you openly air your depression and complain, vent, and drag other people down? Or are you actively hiding it and pretending to be a functioning member of society to at least not be a social pariah? 

Because if I wasn't acting and pretend to have a semblance of optimism, I know based on experience NOBODY would be in my life even if I never talked about my depression.

Even though I'm major depressive all my life, I'm also the most proactive person ( gym 5x week, 1 hour weekly volunteer work, weekly book club, 2 hours week random Udemy course for continued self improvement, etc. Nobody believes this though because for all I do, it seems impossible to anybody that I'm constantly ""ideating."" | Hi, sorry, was that a typo? Did you mean to say ""that others DON'T want to be a part of.""? | 100% TRUTH | They complain that she takes too many days off for her condition and that she uses sciatica as an excuse to be a victim.

I feel like there are so many people out there who are just a step away from what she did so why is it that we blame her for being this way but not the underlying factors and people who made life worse for her. | > I was able to push through because I CANNOT and WILL not let my mom bury me.

I'm so proud of you for believing that, please stay. | That sucks so much. It was nice having her around. This might be offensive, but it just feels bad to think that all of those academic discussions or talks about favorite anime or Japanese restaurants didn't mean anything to her in the long run or even if they did mean anything, nothing was ever enough to make her stay. She did not even leave a note for her friends or family. I absolutely do not want to call it selfish, but it really does feel bad. But I do get your point, and it makes so much sense. | I don't know, she was always so nice but yet so quiet. I found it fascinating and low-key concerning, so I always tried to get into a conversation with her. I thought she already had close friends, and I do too, so we possibly can not be close friends. Hence, I didn't mind that she was not initiating any conversations. But now I feel bad that she was suffering so much and none of us knew. Thank you for your response, tho. I saw that you're pretty active on this sub. Does helping people out make you feel better, or do you have other reasons? | Well, you may or may not be a good guy, but your words sorta helped me understand her better and find a closure that I couldn't have gotten from her even if she had survived this attempt cause I'm probably over thinking the loss of someone who wasn't even close to me. So that makes you a great person, in my opinion.

Being high-functioning while being depressed is like having a double life and I hate it.

I‚Äôm 41. I remember a time when I was excited for the future. In my 20s and early 30s I had plans and hopes for what I wanted out of life. I wanted to design games or write books. I wanted a house with a big piece of land so I could grow a big garden/food forest thing and maybe keep bees or animals. I wanted to be married and have kids and see them grow up into interesting people.

Then I started dialing back. 


I‚Äôd get a job writing about games. I‚Äôd have a little two bedroom house with a small back yard where I could have a little herb garden, some zucchini or something. A wife, a kid, a dog.  Still decent.

Dial it back some

Ok. I‚Äôll work my call center job but I‚Äôll have a blog or something where I write about my interests. A decent apartment with a patio. And some fruit and veggie plants in flower pots. My girlfriend and a dog.

Now the only dream I can realistically imagine for myself is one where I‚Äôm alone. I work my unfulfilling call center job. I live alone. I don‚Äôt have friends to hang out with. I don‚Äôt have anyone in my life so I can‚Äôt disappoint anyone else. One bedroom apartment. Studio maybe. And some time before I get too old to make it to the bathroom by myself I end things.

The only happy fantasy I have is a recurring daydream where I didn‚Äôt fuck everything up. I stayed on my meds in high school and graduated and went to the college i wanted. I dated the girl I liked because I wasn‚Äôt so afraid of rejection that I never asked her out. I got the job I wanted, the house, the homestead, the family, the friends.

Social anxiety sucks so much ass and I wish easier to manage if not get rid of entirely. I cant say I don't relate to the second half of your comment because I feel that way all the time, but just know that kind people like you make a positive difference in this world even if it may not feel like it most of the time. Thank you for your comment, and sorry for the late reply! | I'm so sorry you can relate:( social anxiety is such a shitty thing and nobody deserves to be cursed with it.

I used it semi-subconciously because I've also been called it a bunch by my family and just like you said, it hurts and starts to make you think you really are :( I'm sorry that youve have to endure that garbage, some people really sucküòû

unfortunately I can relate to the part about always feeling like everyone's watching and judging, and like you I feel like a nuisance if I stay in a place too long :(( it really sucks.

I'm so proud of you!! Any progress is good progress, and I'm glad you can admit and come to terms with the fact that it's not as quick as you would like it to be.

I know I haven't seen you and I'm not sure what you consider ugly, but I sincerely doubt you are! You have a beautiful personalityüå∏

Maybe im just complaining for no reason but I never had such a big life crisis or identity crisis before it‚Äôs eating me alive.

I also had gotten into some bad habits and tried chasing that feeling I once felt by my ex and ended up being with the wrong people that broke me even more. I was doing poetry occasionally and did end up writing a song but now i just feel like its too late, like you said, to do anything about it or continue with it.

u/davetheshyguy,179,"I'm 42 and I've lost interest in life I used to be obsessed with all four sports, talk radio, music, movies, and just playing around online. For the past 5 years I've gradually lost interest in everything and this past year has been real bad. I'm basically down to the NFL and I fear it won't be long before I no longer give a damn about that either. 

I've tried to replace these things with new hobbies or interests but it all seems like a waste of time. Like I'm just doing it to do something. A time waster  isn't a passion. 

I've been to therapy and I'm currently on antidepressants for anxiety mainly but it's obviously supposed to help depression.

It's kind of scary, I mean, I literally wake up with no joy. Nothing to look forward to and I don't know how to turn this around.

Has anyone experienced this? WTF do I do? ",u/davetheshyguy,15,"Thanks, buddy. It's rough. | Appreciate it. I think it's gotten worse with social media.

u/deadlysxns,252,"Dead At 18 I'm actually gonna commit. I've worked out a date and time and plan. My entire life I've been ignored and overlooked and I've felt nothing but alone and hopeless, and this subreddit helped solidify my decision. I've made two posts prior and have received nothing. No one cared. Just like real life. I fit no where else in life so maybe it's just time to fully fade into the background. Three days after my 18th birthday I will overdose and die in my childhood home, in my childhood room. Depression has taken everything from me, and now it will finally take my life. Thanks to everyone who never cared, it made leaving that much easier.

EDIT: First off I wanna thank everyone for leaving nice messages both in my inbox and on this thread. Second, I'm not dead yet. I spent the last 2 or 3 days in bed sleeping, I'm not joking. I would wake up and then immediately go back to sleep so I haven't seen the notifications until today. I thought that I should come on here and explain a few things about myself. For everyone who thought my depression was circumstantial that is incorrect, I struggle with clinical depression which basically means that all the sadness is mainly cause by a chemical imbalancein my head. I should also preface that I am a drug addict, I do both coke and heroin semi-regularly and have been for months as a way to cope with everything going on. And lastly I cannot be saved. I feel bad and guilty basically telling everyone that I'm still going through with it cause now I feel as though I've wasted everyone's time that they spent writing out those nice messages. I especially feel bad for all of the people who told me about their own personal experiences in an attempt to help me. I'm still going to go through with my original plan and if I live then I live and if I die then ig that's it.

u/depgirl96,81,"my experience in my suicide attempt (which I survived) yikes Basically I couldn't take it anymore, and the main thought was that the medications don't work at all and I swallowed 80 medications, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, analgesics, clonazepam, among others that I don't remember.

The moment I did what I did I remember lying in bed and I lost consciousness. In my head I seriously thought I had died and I was in a place where everything was white and there was nothing, I wanted God to be there but there was nothing.

Outside, my sister tells me that when they found me, I got out of bed and threw myself on the floor, I was in zombie mode. All this happening at the same time.

In the end they took me to the doctor who obviously admitted me, but I felt like it was all for nothing.

Half the time I just cry without feeling much of anything, I am not plagued by sadness, I am just aware of what a pathetic being I am. | I don't see depression as an illness, more like a mindset. An immature mindset that stops you from doing the basic things an adult should be able to do.

There are many types of intelligence, but I feel the ones that are mostly impacted are emotional intelligence and especially problem solving. Not like math problems, but life problems.

Like I am lonely, I am unsatisfied, I am tired, I am immature, there are ways to change and improve, I'm sure, yet all I do is mull and wallow, sleep and cry. Like a goddamn baby who needs someone else to solve their problems. | Crying is only good for children who don't know how to speak and express themselves yet, who need a constant caregiver.
I am an adult, I should know how to be independent and assertive, how to deal with things without crying like a baby. | I feel like with depression one just wallows in self pity, comes here to vent and look for some kind words, then go back to mulling over things without ever changing.
Intelligence is about problem solving. If you've got something in your life you don't like you solve it, you change something in order to feel better.
But me I am stuck in a boring routine, where I struggle to make any decision, where I just go to bed and sleep because I don't know how else to spend time.
I am alone and will remain so with this attitude. In therapy they keep hinting at the fact that one needs to have the desire to change, but I just don't feel it, I just want someone to talk to so that I don't feel this lonely and isolated. | I am not sensitive, I am just immature and stupid. | It's like this with me sometimes...but other times I just weep, in public, which is so embarrassing. The rest of the time I'm just empty. 
Most of the time I don't even have a reason to cry, I don't feel much of anything, don't think much of anything anymore. Feel brain dead. | People think that for sure. I feel pathetic. | What? Intelligence is about problem solving, depression is about problem wallowing.
Don't you think? | I suppose you are correct. I just feel dumb. I used to write and enjoy it, now I am unable to. I've got nothing more to say, I can't think anymore.
I tend to attribute this to my lack of Intelligence. It sheds a negative light also onto everything I've managed to archive up until now. Perhaps it was all delusion pushing me forward, but reality is I'm worthless, unintelligent and not witty enough.

u/hiromiyag,111,"I fulfilled my dream of moving to Japan and I hate it here I've been depressed since like 2022 I think. I thought last year was better, it felt pretty stable though I was rarely happy. I was studying Philosophy and Japanese in college and after graduating this year I had plans to move to Japan with my boyfriend and stay here one year.

I was really unsure about it, but I put it down to just being scared as I usually am. While preparing for the move I was very stressed and felt pretty bad in general, but I thought that after arriving it would get better. And well, we came here like two weeks ago and not only did it not get better, it got like a hundred times worse.

We're in Osaka, which is a big city and I've underestimated the toll such a place could have on me - I'm from Europe and my country's big cities are like small towns compared to this. I feel trapped, all the things that seemed fascinating to me before now seem foreign and scary. I don't enjoy almost anything here, even though I was looking forward to it before. I cry everyday and my suicidal thoughts came back after being gone for one year. I miss my home, family and friends very much. I have my boyfriend's support and he tries to help, but he likes it here and doesn't really understand how I feel. I know it's hard on him as well and that makes me feel really bad. 

I try to do things everyday, go out, I even found a job and my first day is next week. I'm terrified though, I don't know if I can do it with how weak and fragile I feel all the time. I'm really scared that I'll break down during my shift or something and well, since Japan is known for its stigma around mental illness I don't know how my colleagues and boss would react. A few days ago I broke down during a get-together at our house with some friends and had to leave. I sat in a nearby park and cried on the phone to my mom for over three hours until everyone left. 

I wanna go home so bad. Almost everyone says that it's hard at first and it'll get better after I settle in but I don't know how long I should wait until that happens. I try so hard to like it here and nothing helps, at best I feel okay sometimes, but still I feel awful everyday and I can't see it getting better in the slightest. 

I don't know what to do anymore, I feel so hopeless and scared. ",u/hiromiyag,2,"Wow, thank you for this great comment, it actually made me cry (in a good way)! I think the deadline thing sounds good - I told myself that if I feel okay-ish throughout Christmas time, I'll stay if I want to. I'm not religious, but I've always spent Christmas with my family and not being able to do that this year is one of the hardest things for me.

The perspective of going home in the near future does make me feel much better. I'll try treating this as a holiday as well, maybe trick my brain into chilling haha. Thanks again! | I'm so sorry you had to go through something like this. But I'm glad it got better in the end and you got to enjoy your stay. Thank you for sharing your story, it's amazing you overcame all of that. 

I decided that if my suicidal thoughts get more intense I'll just go home, it would be a good indicator that it's the right thing to do I think. I hope it doesn't get to that though. | Thank you! I did read about culture shock and in my case it looks like it went straight to phase 2 for some reason. That's why I felt that maybe I shouldn't have come here at all. But unless it gets worse I decided to give it some more time for now and try to enjoy it if I can | Yeah, you're right, I haven't considered the culture shock at all. I was studying Japanese and Japan in college for a few years and I guess I was pretty naive in thinking my knowledge of the language and culture will rid me of experiencing it. 

We moved here mainly to improve our language and experience living and working here, but I have a part-time job at a restaurant I can quit anytime, so nothing's really holding me here. My boyfriend wants to stay though, and my family and some friends had plans to visit us in spring. I thought I could make it at least until then for them, but I know they wouldn't want me to be unhappy just for that. I know I shouldn't, but I still feel really guilty about letting everyone down though. | Yeah, I feel like this is what I want, but I'll try to give it some more time for now. If it gets any worse then I'm moving back home for sure | Yeah, looking at my life I think I can say the same. Sometimes it got better, but only temporarily. Sometimes, like in this case, it got worse. 

Thanks, I'll try to make it for the 2-3 months at least, unless I feel any worse | Thank you, that's really good advice. Reminds me of what my therapist once told me - to look at my future with curiosity, rather than fear. It's hard to do sometimes and I often forget to try and do that, so thanks for reminding me!

Right now I'm pretty sure I can't make it through the whole year. Apart from just feeling terrible in general, I feel like I want to go home and the perspective of returning home relatively soon makes me feel better. I'll still try to enjoy my time here though, and I guess there is some possibility that I'll stay the whole year, but thinking about it now stresses me out very much, so I'll leave that decision to future me. | Thank you, that's great advice. I think it works perfectly for my boyfriend - he loves shopping and whenever he feels bad he just goes to a shop and comes back feeling better. 

For now I feel like shops here are quite overwhelming for me also, they're just so different and that's what I kept focusing on when visiting them. But I'll try what you said with a new approach. Thanks! | I was on medication in 2022-23, but after I felt ""stable"" I got off it. From what I read and heard from friends, Japan has a very strict policy on antidepressants, so if I decide to get medication and can't get what I need here I'll have to return home | I didn't come here to cure my depression, I came here because it has always been my dream to do so and I thought I could keep my depression in check, because I've been feeling okay for the past year, as I mentioned. 

It proved much more difficult than I thought is all. | Yeah, I feel kinda stupid that I'm living many people's dream (and my old self's as well) and I feel so terrible. I'd gladly switch places with these people if I could. I guess it just shows how depression and mental illness can twist your view and feelings | That's definitely true and I know that. But like other users said it's not helpful to say that to someone in a bad situation. I guess I'm doing quite okay in life objectively. And despite that I feel terrible, and I don't know what to do anymore to feel better, because it seems like no matter what I do it's still as bad or worse | Yes, I'm trying them out now.

It took years to come to the point where I am comfortable with the idea. I know exactly how and where I‚Äôll do it. I just have nothing left. My family never loved me, which caused me develop into an awkward and weird person. I used to love my daddy, remember him coming home every night and getting so excited I‚Äôd fling myself out of bed every night to hug him. 

My mom and dad divorced when I was around 4, I was heartbroken and thought my mom was so mean for getting rid of him. I didn‚Äôt cope well. Anyway, he ended up being a deadbeat who didn‚Äôt give a shit about his daughters. One time, he even compared us, and said my sister was better looking. I was fat then lol, lucky me I was the less attractive daughter I guess! :) 

My mom stopped hugging me when I was 5-6, and I didn‚Äôt understand why. She blamed me constantly for things, and tore me down when I was already low. My passions and interests were annoying to her.

I have developmental issues (ADHD) that went untreated and no one tried to help, so I dropped out of high school. By the time I was a teenager, I was so extremely antisocial that I lost connection with everyone. I only learned how to read and fear people, how to stay off their radars to protect myself. I erected walls around my heart and mind.

 At this point, I self-sabotage any relationship that could possibly be good out of fear I‚Äôm going to be rejected, my standards for friendship and love are so high they belong in a novel, because no one will ever be enough for me. And I know I‚Äôm not enough for anyone either.

u/jeonkoo_,81,"i'm 18 and suicidal as i sit here crying in my bed as usual, i've decided to finally reach out to someone just anyone who could possibly see or aknowledge that i'm alive and that i'm also on this planet. I feel incredibly lonely, i have no friends, i don't go to school, i don't work, i don't leave the house. No one knows i exist.

I left my home-country together with my family 3 years ago and left everything behind hoping and wishing for a better life. I didn't have the best lifestyle or a huge group of friends, but i had friends i had school and i had freedom, i had a life. I was happy. I never thought i would end up like this or spend my days taking care of my family and my younger brothers waking up to cleaning all day long to cooking and putting my brothers to sleep. My father is abusive and extremly controlling, i can't leave the house or use my phone during nights etc. the only times i'm allowed to leave the house is when i have to follow him to the grocery store to help with the groceries. I'm not allowed to have social medias or stay in my room for too long. just small details i think anyone would find normal and not weird or ""wrong"". i'm tired of being controlled, i can't decide when i want to shower or when i want to do anything on my own. i used to love art, but i have no time for it anymore. I have no time for my self and there is no point in life.

I ended up in hospital a few months ago when i cut my self pretty deep 3 times in hope that it would frighten or bring any type of attention from my parents but everything is back to normal. I still hurt and cut myself but i know i have to do it somewhere they wouldn't be able to notice otherwise i'm pretty sure they would be very mad and hurt. I used to be very good in school and had so many A's, my dream was to work as a therapist... which is kind of ironic now that i'm searching for one..

i have one friend left that i used to be friends with back in my homecountry, she is my best friend and my only hope in life even though shes depressed as well. She's been starting to go to school more and has more friends and i'm scared that she's going to leave me. She has been getting a bit more distant from me and is usually pretty quiet and busy during calls. i feel so mentally abused by my father, i'm stressed 24/7 and especially around him. I'm scared he's going to find out i have social medias or just anything that could make him get mad or physically abuse me.

I watch as other people my age goes to school, gets jobs, goes out with friends and travels around the world. I won't be able to get a job in the future, i dropped out during middle school and even if i did get a job my father wouldn't let me mostly because i'm a female. I'm too scared to take my life, i'm scared for my younger brothers and that they won't see me as they grow. i'm scared that i will make my parents embarassed and embarass my whole family. But i'm constantly thinking about it, i've tried to choke myself and find any rope or any item i could use to unalive myself. I'm not sure where i'm going with this, but i'm very serious about this and i just want to share this, if anyone even would be interested. I think i need help",u/jeonkoo_,3,"hii! thank you so much for sharing, i've been thinking of getting myself a kitten as a pet to at least live for and take care of. I hope that might help.. ! | i really would want to, but i'm just too scared. i don't know what to do and what if it fails and nothing happens, istg he's going to kill me. i feel like i will destroy the whole family and just embarass everyone.. :/ | he would kiiiiilllll me if he found out and i'm scared it's going to fail, especially where i live now they prob don't gaf, sigh. I feel like i would destroy the family and just embarass myself.. :/ | thank you very much for sharing.. i feel like the country i live in now wouldn't gaf and if i failed i would simply be killed. Everyone would hate me and just be dissappointed in me, then i would have to live with probably even more ""rules"" and just no life at all. I feel like he has brainwashed me because i sometimes do feel bad for him and he makes me feel like i'm the villain here. I'm trying to constantly remind myself of everything he has done to me and that literally all my problems are because of him, he's the root of everything. He's trying to manipulate me by letting me know how proud he is and how much he loves me, then the next second he's cursing me out for ordering some food for myself when i was home alone with my OWN money. basically anything i do, if i forget to bring something or just sleeping too late, he get's mad at everything i do. It was fine at first when i could go to school and at leats go out on my own, it was better because i had free time, but now i'm sticked to him and the rest of my family literally 24/7. I'm being controlled. My mom let's me know that she's sorry she brought me and the rest of my siblings into this situation and i understand that she can't do much abt it because we literally left our homecountry to come live in his homecountry. She just hopes for me to find a partner that i can hopefully leave this house with, otherwise my dad won't let me leave. It's a mess, our whole family is a mess and i wan't to get out of here and leave forever, i want to live my own life where i can decide when i want to go out, when i want to shower or when i want to eat. I'm considering online therapy but it feels extremly uncomftorable for some reason... :/ | thank you, i hope so! | thank you for sharing!! it's ""nice"" hearing people with similiar stories because i don't feel as alone. Well it's not nice but i hope u see where i'm coming from. Honestly where i live no one gaf and if i failed my dad would kill me and just hate me the rest of my life. I would dissappoint everyone and embarass everyone, idk what to do or where to go, i feel like suicide is my way out and even though i want to do it but know i won't do it for now at least, i do feel like the day is getting closer and closer and i spend everyday considering it... | i cannot go to the gym because my dad doesn't let me leave the house.. however i saved up for a treadmill which i bought to try to think of something else and just improve my mental and physical health. But i gave up, i gave up because i have no fucking time.

I keep my head down and try to get small wins each day (exercise, cleaning, self care etc) in hopes that one day they will snowball into big wins.

I think a big thing for you might be positive self talk. Treat yourself like you would treat someone you love dearly. Don‚Äôt speak to yourself negatively only positive affirmations. It is a long road and there are many bumps and detours. If you can start believing in yourself in small ways maybe some light will come into your life. 

Love yourself first. You deserve that | Thank you! | I guess that‚Äôs probably true. I am in great shape because of the mandatory physical activity I force myself to do everyday. Attracting another woman is not what I want though. I don‚Äôt see myself as someone that a woman would love for myself. I have had a few loves in my life but that have all left me as soon as they see the true me. The act of being outgoing and funny is great on the surface. Women do not want weakness especially emotional weakness. They want to be protected and have someone who carry‚Äôs their own weight silently | I just don‚Äôt want to be a burden on anyone. As men we have been taught to carry on our own. I find it hard to talk to anyone about my mental health other than my therapist.

I designed a mask for myself at a young age through trial and error. Someone who is smart and funny and gregarious. Someone people want to be around. This is the mask I wear everyday.

Sometimes in the past I have taken it off to relax and find peace in relationships. My partner has always left me soon after. This taught me that showing any vulnerability was not worth it in order to keep a relationship. 

When I had a breakdown 3 years ago I described it to myself as if I no longer had the strength to lift my mask anymore. I lost my job and career. I lost my relationship. I lost almost everything | Thank you for the encouragement. I hope you receive many blessings for your kindness | Thank you I will read it and get back to you.

Thank you for your kindness | Thank you kind stranger it does mean a lot that you took time to reply | Ok nice. Can you maybe share a link? | I keep coming back to your words:
Depression is your body sick of playing a character it hates. This has been so powerful to me the past day or so. You have no idea what it means to finally have something that makes sense. I know that for sure I will not show vulnerability to any females in the future. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I need to wear the mask full time | All the best to you too kind stranger | No I am in a complicated situation.

u/junkoab,86,"My dead best friend saved my life Almost 3 weeks ago my best friend of 8 years committed suicide, leading to me and my friends finding her bleeding on the floor. It traumatized me so much, I started having worse flashbacks as soon as I closed my eyes, picturing the exact moment of finding her laying there in the kitchen. 

She was the closest person I‚Äôve ever had. We always took each other‚Äôs side. Whenever we fought, we would find solutions together right after. So, the realization that seeing her for the last time, would be in her casket hit me hard. 

2 day ago I was in an episode and decided this was it for me. I couldn‚Äôt genuinely grasp the idea of living in this world without my only light. I put our playlist on and cut into my wrist. I was bleeding out to ‚Äú100‚Äù by Dean Blunt, which was one of our favorite songs we‚Äôd smoke to at night. At one point, after I passed out my flashbacks came into my mind. I saw her, once again on the floor, on the verge of death.
Right after, I woke up screaming and realized I‚Äôm still there in my bed, bleeding out same as her that night. Something in me got the courage to stand up. Dizzy, I barely walked to get a cloth to try and patch myself up. 

What happened gives me a lot to think about. At that moment I felt like this was her sign from Heaven that I can keep slowly, step by step going further in life with her guarding over me. Even though I won‚Äôt ever be the same as I was with her, she gave me hope that I can keep going.",u/junkoab,19,"Thanks.

I wouldn‚Äôt have expected, that simply just seeing her in a coffin would affect me so much. | Yeah, I‚Äôd like to think it wasn‚Äôt just a coincidence, that I saw her in that exact moment.

with my friends, the ones i do have, i interact with familiar cursing and overall very dark humor but that‚Äôs because we‚Äôre like that. yet i know i can‚Äôt do that with my extended family because they‚Äôre weirdly conservative and religious but they‚Äôre family. despite i am a leftist and atheist. 

wednesday i faked an appointment because i didn‚Äôt want to drive for hours for sightseeing because i was tired and my knee hurts a lot. anyways yesterday i truly felt like everything went well. in fact, i felt like i acted like my real self. i was happy. i laughed and even interacted with one of my cousins. 

yet when i came home my mom literally started scolding me. exclaiming that i shouldn‚Äôt had said i was bored halfway through the day. i do admit i did say that but that‚Äôs because i always say it with my parents. we were in the middle of traffic and my knee was hurting pretty bad and we weren‚Äôt doing much. so i started saying random stuff which made everyone laughed and then said ‚Äúim sorry i say stupid random stuff when im bored‚Äù. well turns out it was wrong. 

then, at the end, i started being playful with my cousin. i‚Äôm 20 and he‚Äôs 24. We were flicking each other and trying to tickle each other. at some point, i decided to do as if i was gonna lick him. i used to do that with my other cousin when we were eight and i don‚Äôt know what else to do. it was all in good fun and faith. he was holding me down and i was going to lick him and he had to get and get away from me. i actually felt happy because i was making a connection. yet afterwards my mom scolded me saying that was a horrible thing to do and sexual even. so now my aunt thinks im attracted to my own cousin. 

my mom told me im already 20 so i should know what to do and not to do and what i did was horrible. she said she was horrified by the way i acted. and never thought of telling me before because normal people don‚Äôt act this way. 

this saddened me a lot. i thought i was doing good but turns out i fucked it up as i always do. i can‚Äôt be a normal person.

I'm obviously grieving, which has been extra hard considering the whole depression thing. I'm taking my pills so that helps, but I'm an intern on a hospital and seeing the machines and sick people just makes me remember those days at the hospital with my mom, how much she suffered, how sick she got. she couldn't even speak. it hurts just to think about. 

im finding it hard to deal with life rn. it sucks so much. it's so fucking unfair. i'm gonna keep going bc my mom raised me so i could live and i will make her efforts worth something, but it is so fucking hard. always was, for me, but now it's even worse. i wish someone could help me, but I've never been more lonely.

I've also changed since she left, a lot of things are less important know. I guess I know what real pain and suffering is now, so small stuff doesn't bother me as much as it did before. It's like a shift on perspective.

I do like my job, it's just the constant reminders of her illness that hurt me... if I wasn't in a hospital I'm sure it would be easier, but I've got no choice in this department. I've gotta learn how to desensitize myself.

I was trying to get used to the idea of her not being around anymore, bc at the end I knew she wouldn't make it. But you cant really make your brain understand that someone's leaving.

I have no friends, I've never dated, I have a terrible seasonal job, and I'm dependent on my parents. I've totally failed for someone at this age. Many people my age have gotten married and have careers not crappy seasonal jobs. I'm in the bottom percent on so many basic aspects of life. Bottom percent on still being a virgin at 27, bottom percent on having not one friend, and bottom percent on yearly earnings. I have avoidant personality disorder and people are repulsed by my over it or my ugly face. I have a five year old IT degree that's providing zero value to me while I work manual labor jobs.

u/pureparedo,413,"anhedonia is a cruel joke Anhedonia is a symptom of depression, the lack or reduced ability to feel pleasure. I think it's the worse part of depression, we all experience sadness at some point, but when coping mechanism don't work how can someone realistically function in society. Is the entirety of adult life just coping or is that just the people like me. I couldn't imagine growing old and feeling this way.

Some people say they love life and are rarely depressed. The last time I felt thay way I was a child. I haven't felt like that for at least 7 years. I really do think I'm screwed. When you have depression for a while it really becomes painful. The anxiety too. I don't function like a healthy person. I'm always tired. Even when I'm thinking of nothing. I feel empty. I think much of it comes from childhood neglect. I don't think I'll ever feel safe or loved. I don't even know what it feels like. Being  around people gives me anxiety. 

When I try to be a normal person with healthy habits. I have mental breakdowns. Doing anything consistently even eating or sleeping normally is so tiring. If I do one productive thing, I'm drained. I feel nauseous often lately.

I don't know what it feels like to want anything. If I could sleep forever I would.

u/qtpat00tie,157,"""Happiness is a choice"" - my therapist. After years of rotting away at home I finally decided to seek out therapy. It's everyone's go to suggestion so I convinced myself to try it... And a few appointments in, after I explained my life story and the health issues I face - IBD, super fucking loud Tinnitus and VSS - she said that I need a mindset change and that I am choosing to be depressed? I nearly fell off my chair when she said that. Her reasoning was that there are people without limbs or more severe health conditions living 'full' lives therefore I have the choice to do that too and 'inspire' others? 

I was walking through a quiet forest last week, and I could barely hear the birds sing.. but because I 'look' healthy, people assume that I'm fine. 

When I showed her how loud my tinnitus is she said to turn it off immediately.. and I hear that every second of every day forever.. and a couple of minutes later, she says that my suffering is a choice. I don't understand. 

I've literally exhaused all my options and there is absolutely no support, even though people always say that support is always there if you seek it out.. How badly I wish that assisted suicide was legal.. ",u/qtpat00tie,2,"IBD is Inflammatory Bowel Disease - severe bowel problems during a period of inflammation; blood and all that nice stuff. 

VSS is Visual Snow Syndrome - seeing 'tv static' in your vision or similar distortions. | If you have never seen a therapist before I think it's worth a try. Going into therapy I had no idea what to expect, and even though I didn't have the best experience, it was still worth it. A lot of people say that finding the right therapist is very hard so maybe you'll luck out and have someone you click with on the first try! 

I think the same, how am I supposed to 'choose' to ignore all of my medical conditions and just 'be happy'? I suppose her reasoning is that even though my issues are out of my control, I have 'control' over how I respond to those issues? I've seen really good doctors who said that there's nothing to be done but live with it, so how else am I supposed to respond?

She constantly called my sister a whore and would demean me because of the methamphetamine that ran through her veins. When I was 7 my sisters ex boyfriend touched me and raped my sister. 

When I was 9 my mom left me with my dad and stepmom. They also did drugs. My dad would constantly beat me and my stepmom would constantly lie to his face to get him to beat me and my sister.

In my case I've been hoping for years even though the struggles were increasing each month. I've been trying to be more objective and less emotional in my decision as it's fully irreversible. But objectively I'm in a deep hole with extremely low chances of getting better and I just don't have it in me to cling onto a imaginary miracle.

u/spleefy,91,"Man, seeing how successful my old classmates have been has really hit hard I went to a somewhat elite school in the UK (a private grammar school). I myself was from a working class background and didn't fit in too well, (I wasn't academically very strong, not the best social skills, plain looking at best) and so I was bullied a fair bit and was known as one of the losers. I had one good friend from that school (who's still my best friend today) and a few others who I've lost touch with but that's it. 

I ended up developing my first bout of depression at 16 and dropped out of that school, finished off at a regular school, and went to a low ranking university to get my degree. 

I moved on with my life and didn't think too much about the first school. I've continued to suffer with depression on and off my entire life but this last year has been one of the worst. (I'm 36 years old now btw).

Recently I was feeling really nostalgic about my school days and started looking up everyone who I went to school with, and what I've seen has made me spiral so badly. Every single one of the people I went to school with are really really successful. Whether they are lawyers at top firms, doctors and even a director at the mi5, it's just really hit hard that I'm almost certainly in the bottom 1% in terms of achievements.

What hurts the most is not how successful they are, it's that so many of them stayed friends with each other, and seem to all meet up regularly like some old boys club.

It's made me feel so down thinking I also went to that school, maybe instead of fucking about and not doing any work, I should have concentrated and worked harder, made more effort socially and I could have been one of them as well.

I'm a failure in so many ways (gay with no relationship, only a handful of friends, spend most of my time alone), but seeing how successful so many of my classmates have been have really hit home that it didn't even have to be this way, I had such a good opportunity to be better and I didn't use it.

I'm sorry this is such a ramble, I really need to get these feelings off my chest. If you made it this far, thanks a lot for reading",u/spleefy,16,"Thanks that's really really kind of you to put it like that. It's easier said than done though.

I mean they can‚Äôt force me to a hospital for just saying I feel anxious, right?? | thanks I hope I‚Äôll adjust. the medication (singulair) isn‚Äôt even supposed to cross the blood-brain barrier but there are so many cases (and I think even lawsuits) about people experiencing anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, night terrors, etc. my doctor said it is a rare side effect and I can‚Äôt blame it on the medication yet since I had preexisting thoughts about this but they have gotten stronger in the 1.5 weeks since I started taking it | yeah this is a new doctor I‚Äôm seeing (I‚Äôve only seen her once) and she seemed a little too enthusiastic LMAO she literally said she‚Äôd make sure we‚Äôd find a solution to my health issue (non mental related) and said she reviewed my health history and everything ?? idk if that‚Äôs supposed to be the standard but I‚Äôve never had that level of care from a doctor. she seemed more concerned with my health than I am I‚Äôm ngl (but then again, being sad makes me kinda apathetic about whether I‚Äôll die from health complications) | that‚Äôs true - I didn‚Äôt even think about it like that | so am I allowed to say that? or will they lock me up?

also I lowkey self harm but it‚Äôs not that bad and doesn‚Äôt leave visible marks | and they called the cops on you anyways??? wtf that‚Äôs messed up I feel like that was uncalled for | maybe I‚Äôll say it‚Äôs recommended due to drug side effects (my apt is a follow up for starting a new medication) and say it‚Äôs anxiety? I told my mom I was having ‚Äúrandom‚Äù anxiety and I can say I discussed it being a side effect and this what they did idk üò≠üò≠ I don‚Äôt feel comfortable discussing the depression aspects or any specifics other than random anxiety (I lied and said I have been feeling anxious and not sleeping well for no reason) | also I work full time and drive and I‚Äôm an adult so my parents won‚Äôt need to drive me anywhere or know specifics but I‚Äôm on their insurance plan so they‚Äôd know if I had another appointment and the type of doctor | omg yeah I refuse to take anything that causes weight gain.

And I just don't. I don't believe anything good about me. I need to be shown by others. I need others to tell me they appreciate me, for example, or I just assume they don't. And the more others appreciate me, the more I appreciate myself, and feel I have value. If nobody likes me, appreciates me, etc., then my life has no meaning, no purpose. And I can't like or love myself if nobody likes or loves me in return. How I feel about myself is intrinsicly tied to how others feel about me. And there's no changing that.

Thanks. | I appreciate that. Unfortunately I don't think there's anything anybody can do. I think some people were just meant to never be happy. | >If you are willfully choosing to not be happy without certain people

I totally 100% understand everything and thank you for responding so thoughtfully, it means a lot. This just isn't what's happening. I'm not ""choosing"" to be unhappy without certain individuals. I'm unhappy because these people brought something to my life, they added to my life, and now they are no longer part of my life.

u/throwaway8464729205,118,"What's the fucking point of being alive when life is nothing but pain? Throwaway because people at my law school know my main and I might actually unlive myself if they see this. 
On paper, I have a lot going for me. Succeeded in my dream of going to law school, have a house that is paid off, conventionally attractive (I'm past the point of social mores right now, don't worry, I'm humbled by my overwhelming sense of self hatred) Objectively, my life looks pretty good and I've reliably achieved almost everything I've gone after. 

That being said, being alive has become unbearable. I feel nothing and everything at the same time. I can't connect with people anymore. I'm terrified of every social interaction, and I've been taught through experience that I am not worthy of love in the eyes of others. 

I think that realizing this is what did me in. Around 5-7 years ago, I was consumed by depression and anxiety. I didn't feel worthy of existing, and even now I couldn't tell you why. I just couldn't see my own worth. Eventually, I drug myself out of the pit through a lot of introspection and personal work. I became the person I always wanted to be. I thrived, and it got me to where I am now. I found self-worth, which is something that I'd never experienced before 

Over the last year, things have declined and I'm in a darker place than I've ever been. I actually can't see the point of living anymore. I have gone through emotional hell over the last 3 years. For a while, I was able to compartmentalize. Now, that seems impossible, because how the fuck am I supposed to compartmentalize my feelings of worthlessness when literally almost every person in my life has given me every reason to believe I'm not worthy of love or even respect. 

It isn't in my head. I grew up with a father that, from the time I was 6, ntentionally brainwashed me into believing that my mother (who had primary custody) didn't love me and never wanted me. His entire side of the family helped perpetuate this. He also gave me nothing but conditional love while instilling in me that I'll never be enough for any number of reasons. 

Then, I spent my adolescence being goomed by a grown man under the guise of love. He then used that love to buy my silence as he helped himself to my body and then offered what was left of me to his friends. This is just the worst of it. Not to mention the constant cycle of cheating and leaving, just to come back to do it again. Enter substance abuse. 

Eventually, I got away from him. Met someone who treated me like I walked on water. He wasn't perfect, but he also got the worst, most unhealed version of me and it showed. I'm still not sure that I didn't deserve what he did to me in the end. In retrospect, I think I broke him too. Regardless, after 3.5 years he cheated on me with his ex, told me he didn't love me anymore, and left. Then he came back and spent the next six months using the immense love that I, regardless of my failings, felt for him to get laid while he found his current wife. 

I broke, but it allowed me to put myself back together again, better than I'd ever been before. Who I'd always wanted to be. I told myself that it was okay because it motivated me to become a kinder, healthier, more complete version of myself. 

Then I met the person who I credit with destroying that. He convinced me I could be vulnerable with him. I shared every part of myself, the darkest parts, because he made me feel like I was safe. Until he proved I wasn't. Year one, he turned my trauma into a weapon, oscillating between telling me that I was the most amazing person he'd ever met and punishing me for all of my failings as a human being in his eyes. Year two, I learned that he actually had a girlfriend and an engagement ring to give her the whole time. Year three, he's made it clear that I no longer matter to him. The more he hurt me, the harder I loved him, and I still wasn't enough. And in the end, when I told him how he had broken me, all he had to say was ""Haha sorry"". 

Add in a year of realizing that some of my closest friendships came from the fact that I was around and required nothing from them, and that the second I did, they had no use for me anymore. 

Now I'm alone. I have no one. 

I give and I give and I fucking GIVE. I bend over backwards to show the people in my life that I'd do anything for them, just to be shown that I'll never be good enough for anyone no matter what I do. 

Please don't tell me that it's going to be okay and I'll find my people. I'm almost 27. My life has been nothing but a cycle of everyone I let near me picking my bones clean until I have nothing left to offer them. Then they leave. Everyone leaves. 

I can't even take comfort in the idea that I'll have the human connections that I've been chasing my entire life because even if I do, I've been taught to expect nothing but pain in the end. Why would I seek something out that has never done anything but erode me down to a shell of a person. 

It isn't that I want to die. I just don't know how to convince myself to keep living. I'm empty inside. The only thing I feel is emotional pain so strong that I can't remember the last time that my chest didn't physically hurt. What's the point of any of this? Why would should I keep going when    all I've ever known is abuse that called itself love? 

Why would I fix myself if it's just so someone can come along and break me again? What is the point of believing I have value if no one else sees it.

Although, I didn't do nothing. I went to therapy for 4 years. I have had 7 years of social interaction since then. Socializing did not get any easier. At this point I would rather die than keep trying to improve.

Also saying ""it gets better"" implies that time is the only factor in improving. I've had 7 years and voluntary attempts on my end and it in fact has not gotten better.

I should have kept the mask on, saved up some money and went to a professional to start with.",u/throwawaylife1999,12,"I was with my ex for 5 years. My best friend died while we were together, and it caused me to spiral pretty badly for over a year. I became distant, lost my sex drive and all that. I could tell it bothered her, but I couldn't help it. I talked about it and opened up to her about my past and daily struggles with depression. She said she understood at the time, but then later I found out she had been seeing another guy. I get why she did it, but it hurt. She could have just broken up with me.

That was 5 years ago. I haven't been in a relationship since. | I understand that now. There is no ""fixing"" it, and everyone has their own stuff they're dealing with. I wouldn't expect them to try to fix it. I just felt the need to release and confide in someone because the pressure had built up too much, and I needed to explain some of my behavior.

But it just makes everyone uncomfortable, and worst case, indicates to them, in their mind, that I'm a weak and unreliable person.

I met a guy recently, we hung out at a party and became friends after. I could tell he was a little different, like me. We had gotten pretty drunk late that night and were being open with each other. He had been through a lot in his life, went to prison for some years, but is now doing pretty well for himself. And he said something that has been on my mind constantly since.

""The reality of life is, no one cares. Figure it out. Or don't. It's up to you, all you got is you at the end of the day.""

What he meant was it's no one else's responsibility to fix your life. And he's right. We're all here in the same boat trying to figure this life shit out. | Thank you, I hope everything works out for you as well. | I make throwaway accounts and anonymously vent on Reddit lol. It's nice to at least be able to talk about this stuff with strangers and read their stories. Makes me feel less alone.

You eventually lose the desire to vent to people irl when it sets in that nothing good comes of it. Nothing is to be gained from it. 

It's natural to want to surround yourself with people who lift you up and inspire you. If you're not lifting others up, and are instead bringing them down with negativity, it just pushes them away. So you have to appear strong and positive around people even if you don't feel like it. Otherwise you'll lose them. | Do you tell him you just need to vent? I think a lot of men are hardwired to try to fix everything, and need to be slapped in the face up front with expectations lol. I've been guilty of that. But if he can't just listen, then that might be a problem. | Hey I do love a good trauma dumping session with someone who can relate and open up about theirs too üòÖ It feels good. But I think there is a line, and you have to be selective about who and how open you are. That guy at the party was rare, and even though we're both busy with different kinds of lives and live far away from each other, I feel like we'll at least be good acquaintances for a long time. Plus, he's not someone in my daily life who has expectations of me.

I think I crossed the line with people in my circle when I talked about my suicidal thoughts and other intense thoughts and feelings. Those are the things that really make people uncomfortable and not know how to take it or process it. Or you find out that they consider suicidal people cowards and/or drama queens, which really sucks. | I'm sorry to hear that. I obviously don't know yall or your relationship, but maybe he's just trying his best to help, even if it isn't the response you need at the time.

I'd like to ask your opinion regarding that kind of situation, if you don't mind.

My sister is struggling a lot right now, more than me. It's very bad, as in she may have a more severe disorder such as bipolar. We don't have much family, much less supportive family, and I've been doing my best to try to support her and get her help. In short, nothing has worked and nothing has changed.

What I need an opinion on is how I listen and respond to her now. She calls and texts me basically the same things all the time. ""I feel like my life is over. There's no hope for me. I don't have control of myself anymore. I don't want to exist anymore. Etc."" I don't know what to say anymore, so my responses usually amount to ""I'm sorry, I love you and hope your day gets better."" Sometimes when she calls, I just listen and don't say anything, assuming she's just venting. I can't tell if my lack of a response upsets her or not.

What kind of response do you hope for when venting? Or do you look for one at all?",1gogcwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gogcwi/i_learned_to_stop_opening_up_to_friends_and_family/

He just doesn‚Äôt understand the mental agony I‚Äôm in | I said it to them bc it‚Äôs rent day, I haven‚Äôt been able to pay rent this month as I was laid off, and having UC issues so no income since feb. My gma is amazing and lent me the money, hence me being depressed about it and saying that to her. My bf then came home and asked why I was depressed, I said I feel like a burden as I‚Äôm severely struggling Atm and can‚Äôt work until this episode is over. Then that‚Äôs what happened.

As for everyone else, my dad sexually abused me when I was 4, and my mum had me at 19 and when she had her new kids at a ‚Äònormal age‚Äô witha rich husband, she basically just abandoned me as I was depressed (I had just lost my 3 step sisters and step mom on my dads side so I was grieving and I hadn‚Äôt come to terms with the CSA yet) and didn‚Äôt have the energy to deal with me, 4 kids and a bipolar husband.

And I do not try to burden them with my mental health, I don‚Äôt talk to them about it unless they really pry the info especially my grandmother. I usually pretend to be happy for her but last week I just broke down in front of her when she asked if I was ok.

As for managing it, I do well to try and drag myself out of the depression- but something always happens to ruin it, getting raped, getting pneumonia, getting laid off, getting beaten up on Christmas by my ex, I could go on and on. This is how I‚Äôve gotten to now, my lowest state ever. My boyfriend has never known me depressed properly until now. It‚Äôs usually an internal battle",1c5pqng,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1c5pqng/super_suicidal_today_said_to_my_bf_sorry_for/

I called my Mother and asked her if she can take me to a field, to let everything out.

So I screamed my heart out and at the end got the police called on me. I don't know if I should laugh or cry at this, maybe both.

And thank you <3 that's really nice to hear | It really does, and yeah fair enough tbh. Cuz I didn't hold back and they probably thought something crazy was happening | Yes yes, I made sure to walk really war into the field too. I didn't expect that people far away would actually be able to hear me so it's absolutely fair that the police gut called.

Next time I'll probably drive out more far away. And will bring a pillow too, thanks! | Oh no, sorry I didn't realize how my wording made this look.

I brought a setup to do a trial run as well to make sure it's going to work. If it doesn't, I'll have to source a plan B.

Then all I'll need to get is a bottle of wine and possibly some weed or benzos to numb myself on the day.

Every single moment of today I was on the edge of tears. I was constantly fantasizing about death, of the absence of pain, of existing (sort of, i believe in the continuation of the energy of our soul after we die, i just believe our conciousness ceases to exist in the same form) of the feeling of dying and it finally being over.

I decided to move back to my hometown. It‚Äôs cheaper and it‚Äôs quieter. If I stay in my city now, then I‚Äôll never actually financially get ahead without working myself sick or being miserable. 

It‚Äôs the best thing for me now and while I‚Äôm not suicidal like I was, my brain is still gnawing at me that it would be easier to be dead.

She didn‚Äôt think this would happen so she‚Äôs really just trying to keep me calm and figure out next steps | It was a reason that was valid but it‚Äôs abnormal I got terminated first notice. | I have an MSW and I‚Äôm an LMSW.

To make a decent living you have to have a license, which means grad school. I have a BSW so I only had to spend 12 months getting my MSW. That was nice. 

Different  areas have different needs. Unfortunately I live in St. Louis and there‚Äôs 3 MSW programs in the city, even more in a 50 mile radius. The market is oversaturated and cost of living isn‚Äôt super cheap.

I would ask my relatives to laugh and be happy, i swore to them that when i grow up i would be the fun adult. 

Now that I am an adult, i am no different. In fact, I‚Äôm worse. I fucked my life. Everyone is disappointed. Nobody wants to look at my face. I am repeatedly told that i am a disgrace. They are ashamed of me. They are done with me and i am done with myself too atp. It‚Äôs hard living like this. Even if i go somewhere else i know the damage has been done and it will follow me. I can‚Äôt make friends, i can‚Äôt look at people in the eyes and overall I‚Äôm always scared. Everything that i touch gets ruined. I fucked up life. My parents are the smartest people i‚Äôve ever met and a daughter like me is a disappointment. They deserve better. Everyday i think of ending it. I wish i could disappear or combust. Why is life such a race? Why can‚Äôt we enjoy the little things? Why am i made feel guilty for doing the small things that i like? 

There aren‚Äôt many good things about me. I am honestly such a waste. My dad said investing in me is a lost cause. On a daily basis i wonder how death would feel.

I find excuses to skip drinks with friends, socialising does not seem exciting anymore. Bought a gaming pc for over 1000$ only to get bored off playing (this was one of my dream bucket lists). Watching my favourite band this weekend doesn‚Äôt seem exciting anymore. I released my first single this year, and haven‚Äôt been able to write another so far, not that it meant anything, only 20 people have streamed so far. Relationship with my father has ruined, he hates me I hate him. 

I don‚Äôt think people care about me. In the last 6 months I‚Äôve only gone to handful social gatherings. Suddenly my friend circle has shrunk to null.

u/xAnakin_Skywalkerx,161,"48 hours to go  So yesterday I went to Walmart and successfully bought a bottle of Ibuprofen without my mom finding out. It‚Äôs currently hidden in a drawer in my room. On Tuesday after I get home from morning tutoring, I am going to take the entire bottle. It‚Äôs 100 200mg pills, so it‚Äôll be 20,000mg of ibuprofen at once. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going to happen, and a large part of me is terrified, but I know that this needs to happen. 

I mainly hate lying to my mom. That entire time we were at Walmart yesterday, I had the bottle hidden in my purse and I just felt awful having to act like nothing was wrong the rest of the day. Then at work last night I had absolutely no motivation, and I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt again tonight. I hate having to act happy today, since it‚Äôs Easter. I wish I could tell my mom she didn‚Äôt have to buy all that candy, because I‚Äôll never get a chance to eat it. 

A lot of you think I should stay for my mom, and well, I understand why, but I‚Äôve been doing that for the past 8 years, and nothing has gotten better for me. I‚Äôm sick and tired of waiting and waiting for things to change, but they never seem to do. The worst part about this is doing this to her, because the last thing I want to do is put my pain on her. But at the same time I feel I‚Äôve run out of options. Maybe it‚Äôs selfish, well, it is selfish. But I‚Äôve always been a selfless person, so why can‚Äôt I be selfish for one time in my life? All I can do is hope she‚Äôll be okay in the long run. She has my brother, her sister, her mom. She has people that I know will support her through this and give her a reason to keep going. Just like she did for me these past 8 years. 

Also, to the people saying it‚Äôs not worth it because of the agony it may put me through, I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm in enough mental agony that physical won‚Äôt even be much harder. And at least for that time I‚Äôll be focused on that instead of my dark thoughts.
