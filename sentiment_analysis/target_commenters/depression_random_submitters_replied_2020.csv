u/anonyanonyanony13,32,"Am I wrong for feeling guilty for reporting him? This is all going to sound so stupid but, I am 17 years old and I just recently reported someone close to me for exchanging nudes and engaging in sexual activity online with a minor. 

For background information, I met him when I was around 13-14 years old he was 28 at the time. I was in a really dark place (Lonely, depressed, all of that.. I suffer from childhood neglect and have always been bullied at school, I never felt wanted or loved) and he instantly made me feel special, wanted and loved. In return for this he asked for nudes, he said it was a way to express love for each other and was “necessary in a relationship.” I don’t know why I sent them (keep in mind I was 13-14 at the time, I wasn’t the smartest) but I did. This became an every day thing and became more serious over time, pics were sent, messages were sent, video/voice calls were made. He built a sexual and emotional relationship with me. I was manipulated into thinking he wanted to be with me and that I was everything he wanted, so I felt as if he deserved whatever he wanted from me. 

This kept going on for almost 4 years, I don’t know how I was so blinded to believe he actually wanted me. He talked about meeting me, having a future with me, all that stuff. He did anything to make it seem like we were in an actual relationship, and I believed it all. He made me feel beautiful and was a light in my life that I so desperately needed. He was nice to me, he talked to me 24/7 and was honestly very helpful. He was there when I needed him and he made me happy. 

He’s 31 and I’m 17 now. He recently confessed that the whole time he’s had a girlfriend, never really wanted to be with me and just wanted me for the thrill of the moment. He said he did have “true feelings” for me and was physically and emotionally attracted to me but I was “too young.” 

Hearing this absolutely crushed me and was a huge newsflash to me. I look back to it and don’t even understand how I believed him. I guess I just wanted to feel wanted. Now I realize he probably just saw me as a vulnerable person and used me for years to get what he wanted. 

I reported him for what he did but I feel bad for doing so. I can’t stop crying and I feel like a horrible person for doing something that could possibly ruin his life. I don’t know if what I did was the right thing. I refuse to tell anyone I know about this because I’m too embarrassed. My parents don’t give a shit about me, my friends would just judge me for being stupid.. I have no one to vent to. 

Am I wrong for doing what I did? I’m beating myself up for it bad because I truly think I could never hate him and that maybe he didn’t deserve it.. My mind told me to report him while my heart told me to respect his life and future.. I chose to follow my mind but was that the wrong choice? 

Please don’t make fun of me :( I understand that I was stupid and blind.

I do believe that you would never be able to truly understand someone’s situation until you experience it yourself. I even said in my post that I felt stupid for doing it and have no idea how I fell for it all, but making mistakes is all about growing up. I was young and I didn’t grow up in the best environment which made me more vulnerable than the average child. And yes, it was “grooming” and “manipulation” he knew what he was doing and used my lack of love and affection to his advantage. 

You are entitled to your own opinion, but I think you seriously lack empathy. Wanting to make someone feel bad and stupid for what they did when they were younger and not in a good headspace does nothing but spread more negativity in this world. 

Does bringing down others make you feel better? If you cannot be positive then just be quiet. At least the other people that disagree with what I did gave their opinions on the question I asked. All you came to do was call me stupid and dumb which I already mentioned myself in my own post, you just came here to bring me down.

I can't get out of bed, it takes me an immense amount of energy to perform simple tasks like washing my face, brushing my hair, changing out of my PJs. it takes me hours to get out of the shower. I keep apologising for every little thing. I keep pushing everyone away because of my habits and personality. I can't get out and yell ""excuse me!

u/anonymous-account12,6,"To all who have been diagnosed with depression (or just know they suffer from it), does it feel like it makes you heartless? Or careless? So as my title asks, does having depression or depressive symptoms make one feel heartless? Does it make it difficult to feel empathy (or sympathy) or just any emotion for others, particularly those that are close to you? 

While I’ve never been diagnosed, I highly suspect I have been suffering with depression for over a decade, but it’s shown up stronger than ever in the past 3-4 years. 

Hear me out. I don’t recognize who I am anymore. I used to be ambitious, motivated, and love activities such as reading. Now I can’t pick up a book to save my life. I used to be friendly and curious. Now I isolate myself from everyone and have gone from a handful of friends to one or two. I distance myself from family, lash out at everyone, hate my job, lack the ambition to seek out better for myself, am angry all the time, and lie to myself that I’m fine. I sometimes don’t shower or eat healthy options -think junk food or fast food- don’t take care of myself. Sleep for longer than my body needs. Keep to myself completely. Avoid certain friends or family calls/texts. Etc 

 Anyway, back to my original question, does depression make you a heartless person? I ask cus—I wish I were making this up— in the past few months, I’ve had two family members be diagnosed with cancer, one aunt pass away, my bf’s grandmother pass away from a stroke, and guess what? I feel nothing. I am not a horrible person. But I don’t seem to feel...Past me would feel their pain. Would cry with them/for my family or feel anxious or sad that this is happening. Now... I just go on with my life.

u/anonymousconfessing,1,"In the last 2 weeks, I just had the realisation that i had been sexually exposed at a very young age   So in the last 3 months i have been self caring and getting much better and motivated after being completely detached from reality and not having any emotional feelings and just having meltdowns/mental breakdowns.
  But since i had been exploring myself i just realised that i had been sexually exposed at an extremely young age, which i dont even remember when it started but the only thing i could even scrape up from my memories is that it was; before 1st grade, opened me up to porn somehow ( when i learned reading and writing but i still have zero idea as to how i learned how to search this porn in english because my main language isn't english ).
  And knowing that when i was young and had so many little fragments of being sexually aroused and the only piece of memory i also remember was that the culprit of this was my cousin.
  I have no idea as to how i managed to hide this from my mother or as to why she didn't react if she discovered this.
  I am right now 14 and a male, i made this account because the previous one has my only friends following it. I have been in states which i was so exhausted from these emotions that maybe suicide was an option but i managed to climb out of that, at least to the point where i dont consider it but this has just been the last thing to push me into making this account and then saying this out loud.

u/anonymousdallasfan,8,"I feel empty inside and I can feel myself becoming dependent on alcohol Some context. 
I am 21, I am a successful student and I have friends and family that care about me. I have a girlfriend that is considered to be attractive and I myself am a tall not terrible looking guy who is in decent shape. I am about to graduate college with a degree in aerospace sciences. I have been dating my girlfriend for nearly 4 years, and she is convinced we will marry. You would think that I would feel content. 

How it appears on the outside and how it actually feels inside are completely different. I feel completely dissatisfied with my romantic relationship. I am easily irritated, have outbursts, and everyone in my life thinks I have anger issues. I constantly feel like everybody hates me. I don’t feel like I am liked. I have confidence issues even though I am constantly reminded that I shouldn’t. I look in the mirror and I hate who looks at me. I have no idea who I am, and I feel like I’m having some sort of quarter life crisis. 

There could be a number of things behind these negative feelings. It could be me being nervous for going into the real job market, which is obviously stressful right now. It could be that I’m with the wrong person romantically (This is what I personally think could be behind it all). It could be that I have too many people depending on me for time, as I have a couple friend groups, a girlfriend, family and on top of all that I work 40hrs a week and have schoolwork when it is in session. I really don’t know which of these it could be. 

Now the worst part. I have started to turn to alcohol as a solution. I didn’t think I was until on Saturday evening. I was feeling down as usual and my friend invited me over to have a drink with him and a couple of friends. I was blackout drunk on Friday as well, so I was going to take the night off, but as soon as I got there and had a couple drinks I instantly felt better. I felt like I used to. In that moment I realized that I may be going down a terrible path. I didn’t even realize it, but now looking back to quarantine I think I have developed a problem. 

I need advice. Do I need a change of scenery? Should I shake up all my relationships with others? I have goals and I work hard towards them but it feels empty. I am sorry for typing such a book, I just don’t know what else to do.

I got ghosted by really close friends during my twenties after disclosing my mental health issues (depression, bulimia, anxiety). I recently got ghosted again. The part that hurts the most was that I wasn't even asking her for emotional support. It was more of a ""hey, I want to come clean and let you know that my depression worsened last year to the point where I didn't want to exist anymore. So I sought help, got diagnosed with depression and anxiety, got on meds, and I'm doing better now. I just wanted to tell you because I want to stop hiding.""

No, it wasn't an inappropriate time. We've been friends for 6 years. It was during a deep conversation 3 weeks ago. She has since ignored several texts I've sent her.


As much as it hurts--I WANT TO STOP HIDING MY DEPRESSION. If my friends can't accept what I'm struggling with...are they even my friends? I just want to stop pretending to be fine.


I told another friend tonight. His response:

* you're only depressed because you don't love yourself
* I think you're fixating too much on your depression 
* well, your friends aren't leaving you because you told them about your mental health. It's clearly something else and until you figure it out, you're going to be friendless

u/anotherthrowagain,2,"Does it ever get better? Sorry for cliche title, but it’s genuinely how I feel right now. I was diagnosed with clinical depression two years ago. This was likely something I had been struggling with since I was 7—having gone to therapy at that age for similar symptoms. I was only put on the watchdog list after my failed suicide attempt was caught and sent to the emergency room. I was so mad at the time, I remember I would just wake up and immediately start bawling my eyes out and beg people to leave me alone. In actuality, I was glad that I was caught. I’m a coward, and I felt like shit to even consider talking about my issues with other people. So now I could put the blame on someone else and finally get the help I knew I needed.

Went to counseling, group therapy with other people with similar experiences, family therapy where for the first time I spilled my guts about how I actually felt. And when all was said and done I had a prescription of anti-depressants to call my own. I was going to get my life on track.

Maybe it was just some placebo effect or something, but I genuinely felt like something had changed the first several months. I was talking to people more, I was active, I was motivated and looking forward to the future. That faded away and I started slipping back into my old habits, which was immediately noticed by everyone. A stronger dosage of the anti-depressants was given to me, but I noticed no difference.

Back to counseling I went, and I started it again. I was lying to my counselor about how I felt, that things were okay now. They believed it, my family believed it, and I probably believed it for a while too. 

It’s been several months of that. I barely talk to my family anymore, I barely get any work done, and they’ve caught on. Before, I had the excuse that I was depressed. Now I’m on anti depressants, and they probably just think I’m lazy. Maybe I am, and I’m just using depression as an excuse.

This quarantine’s probably brought the worst out of everyone. I’m alone for most of the day; and most of it I’m staring at a wall and doing nothing, I get more and more behind on work, I drift farther apart from family and friends, and my first thought is “oh it’s alright, you’ll be dead in a year anyways.” It’s so fucking difficult, I have all the stuff available to kill myself and I could just do it right now and no one could stop me or even suspect me of thinking about it. 

I’m sorry for this self-indulgent bitchy rant. I don’t know what to do. It feels like I’ve been given all the materials to get myself out of this, but I’ve just thrown it all away and I’m back to nothing. It feels like I’m going to just be like this for the rest of my life, and everything’s already going downhill right now because I can’t be half-assed to make an effort to do anything. I’m just squandering my life away, and I know what I have to do but I just won’t. 

This is probably common when it comes to depression, just feeling like this for years. I don’t even know if I’m still depressed, could just be me acting like a dumbass right now. How are you supposed to deal with it?

Today was going well until I went into work and all of the sudden my chest started to feel heavy and I started to think negatively about myself. I had been doing alright for a week. I was challenging myself to be more outgoing to conquer my social anxiety and attempting to have a genuine smile on my face more often to have pleasant conversations with strangers which is an improvement. I've been reminding myself that I deserve to be happy and that I shouldnt get down on myself because I tend to over think things. I'm not certain if my anxiety is also at play here but I'm definitely feeling something depressing. Does anybody feel the same? if so what kind of strategies or coping mechanisms do you use to avoid this feeling?,u/anti_norm,1,"I'm sorry that you have to go through that. But when it comes to thinking about death, I try and focus on living in the moment and making my current situation as enjoyable as possible. Think of something that you could do that would make you feel alive or something you can do for someone else that would make them feel good. I try self therapy like reading a good book, watching my favorite anime or show and try to drown out the the negativity with distractions. If that doesn't help I also try to meditate for 5-10 minutes just sitting criss crossed, hands on my knees or lap, sitting up straight and closing my eyes in complete silence until I've hit the 5 minute mark. I usually feel a little bit better afterwards and if not I keep meditating. I hope this somewhat helps. | It's okay, if I can be of assistance that makes me feel good anyway. I just did the meditation thing right now and i do feel a little better. Hopefully the rest if my shift doesn't ruin that 😅 by the way when you try it, focus on your breathing and relax yourself especially your eyes, and set a timer so you're not just sitting there. have a good night Noop!",en26fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/en26fn/clinical_depression_strategies/
u/antia2,2,"Not going to get better then this? Not sure where to start 35 years old male from Scandinavia.(note a lot of rambling)

My life has basically turned to this.  
Sleep, work, workout, go home, watch YouTube and repeat.  
On weekends sometimes I meet some of my old friends that I don't really feel connected with any more. Some work okay, some take a lot of space and due to old habits they dominate the space and just talk about what they want to talk about.  
The result being that I'm usually not talking much and not really enjoying the company either(this is like old childhood friends).  
When we meet or talk online the focus of the talk is always about what we are doing right now, like playing online games or whatever we do right then. We rarely talk just for the sake of talking.

I have always got along better with women then men and have had a few really good friends but as time goes by most of them have gotten into relationships, house, children etc and I just meet them occasionally and not in the same way as it was before.(Even though I don't know if the relationship was better before) I'm not being excluded or anything it just feels like I have nothing to talk about or if I talk about something I don't get any response.

One or many of my (female) friends have had their own problems with depression and even suicide attempts and I guess that I have felt good having focused on their problems and their well being and neglecting my own.  
And I think that this is a key aspect to how I feel about life, I try to ignore my own needs and find someone to focus on instead. 

On work I mostly function like a human being, talking with my colleagues, even being active in the Union and doing things way above my pay grade, talking with HR and the CEO about things.  
But this is mostly a mask, a facade that I play and if I am forced to keep the social skills up for too long they will crack and I will turn back into my usual self. This is mostly noticeable during after works or out of work activities. 

I've sometimes tried to open up to some new ppl but have experienced an uninterest or rejection and quickly turned the conversations into about them instead. My old close friends that now live happy with children, house etc. was the ones that I could really talk with but now I feel like i don't want to bother them with problems when they have finally got some order into their lives.  
So basically I have no one that I feel comfortable to talk with anymore and everyone I know have been reduced to  superficial relationships. And it have been like this for maybe 10+ years now, now I've always been shy but not to the point where I can go days without talking with another human(when not working) .

I also have no real relationship with my family and rarely meet them as well, it is not like we have a bad relationship it just basically non existent.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to me to be honest I have little to none self aware of my feeling and have a really hard time to recognize what I'm feeling, I am a logical person and understand the basic ideas and can understand when ppl feel a certain way but just by ""playing the game"" doing what is expected of me.

I'm not sad, I don't have panic or anxiety or anything. I'm rarely happy, I can laugh at things but mostly I feel that I just am in a void.   
I've talked to a therapist a few times and I think it was really hard for me and him. His approach is to ask questions and try to get me to open up about what I feel about things, but my answer to ""how do you feel"" is usually ""I don't know"" and can only answer in the most basic feeling terms ""ok"", ""bad"", ""good"" etc.  
The conclusion that we got after about 10 session was that I had problem to connect with people and maybe a mild depression.  
I was not really fitting into any of the boxes I got the 10 sessions and didn't really feel like it was going anywhere so I ended it, also because it was payed by the health care and I thought that the time and money was better placed on someone that have ""real problems"".  
I also used anti depressants for about 1-2 years but didn't feel any different and when they ran out I just quit.

&amp;#x200B;

So who am I?  
Well I have a good education and a well paying job in IT, I also run my own (1 person) company and have a successful app that provides me with passive income on the side. So my finance is more then okay.   
I have no real interest in things, brands, cars, clothes etc. so I stockpile the money and spend most on food.  
I'm mostly on the nerdy side with using the computer a lot, used to play a lot of games, watching movies, Netflix etc.  
Then I also really love to travel and have been traveling many times, usually month long trips and many times alone since I have no one to travel with. When I travel I usually go backpacking, using hostels, couchsurfing etc. I like to go to warm countries where I can dive and explore nature. I have been to ""exotic"" places like Amazonas, Chernobyl and Fukushima (japan).   
I'm not comfortable at clubs so i usually avoid the party life when I travel but I do enjoy drinking and pubs etc. I guess that the good thing with travelling alone is that I'm able to keep up my social skills for just long enough to talk with ppl for the day before I move on.

When it comes to drinking I'm not really sure if it is a problem or not but I have built up quite a tolerance and I can and often easily drink a bottle of wine by myself on the weekends in like 30min, I drink often when alone but I don't get to drunk, in social drinking I guess that I spend more time on drinking then other things, easier to drink and let other ppl talk. Even drinking don't really open me up much.

Romantic relationships?  
Well I've had a few but I guess that due to the above problems not many of them lasted very long since I'm unable to create the emotional bond needed and even if I sometimes got that from the girl I had a hard time reciprocating and they often ended with me feeling like I've wasted their time. I think the longest relationship I've had lasted 1 year and have had many shorter dating relationships(1 month ish).  
But same I feel like a time waster and I don't even like myself so I have a hard time understanding why they are interested and push them away when it seems to get serious.  
Lately my dating life has gotten worse and I've been rejected even more times than I can count and it is wearing me out. Lack of physical contact is also starting to hurt, almost to the point where I almost hired a prostitute just to snuggle (I didn't hire one, but I thought about it). Haven't gotten a real hug in a year, might also have to do with corona so I guess that is nothing special.  


Well thanks for reading all my rambling, to be honest I don't know what I want, if I didn't exist it wouldn't matter, I'm not suicidal or hurt my self or anything I just am. The only thing I know is that I wish I was more normal, not being quite and not talking with anyone during the weekends.",u/antia2,2,"I have no idea, usually my year revolves around travelling going somewhere, but that might just be a escape and it is impossible this year :s | Nah I don't want to bother her when she finally got her life into order.

The darkness might do it but it is not seasonal, actually like the darkness since it is easier to hide :P.

I guess I can search and see if I find some other therapist, I really feel uncomfortable talking about myself but that is probably the only way forward in the end.",jpgipg,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jpgipg/not_going_to_get_better_then_this/
u/antiexistential,3,"Depression and Relationships Hi, people of Reddit. I’m new to posting, and I wanted to vent but also gather some perspectives. Here’s my story (apologies for the long post):

Regarding my background, I have been struggling with depression for my entire adolescence. It’s something I just became used to, as it was (and still is) a part of my everyday life. My friends were always pretty understanding of it, which I am thankful for. However, no matter how understanding friends are, I find that they never truly can empathize. When I’m at my lowest, the sadness makes my body physically ache and I can’t move. It feels like drowning. And for someone who doesn’t have depression, that feeling is pretty hard to imagine. After all, depression is an “invisible” illness. 

So this is where my predicament begins: in high school I met my boyfriend, whom I dated for about two years. From the very beginning, I made my illness clear and known. We come from very different backgrounds (I have a really hard family life, not including the depression, and his family life is generally good) and I tried so hard to not let my illness affect our relationship. And it was fine, for the most part. We were basically attached at the hip, and he will always hold a place in my heart.  However, he recently broke up with me around the time my depression took a severe turn for the worst. It was probably the worst my depression had been in several months. We just started college this year, so I wasn’t expecting our relationship to last forever; people grow apart, it’s natural. However, I was left absolutely dumbfounded as he broke up with me in a horrible way while I was already in the middle of a horrible depressive episode. Prior to the breakup, he was distant from me for weeks, and I tried several times to have a sincere conversation about it, but it never worked (he always has had a hard time expressing his feelings, another nail in the coffin). Then, I finally got him to admit what he felt. He said that he built up resentment towards me, and I’ll admit, I definitely wasn’t the most pleasant person to be around. But to bottle it all up for weeks until I had to make him admit his true feelings was devastating.  He even said that I was an annoyance, and that he felt as though I was bringing him down. He said he felt “tethered.” These words absolutely shattered my heart. It’s not the breakup itself that hurt me, as I stated before, but it’s the way he made me feel about my depression. As everyone on this sub knows, with depression, you always feel like a burden, like a waste of space. You feel as if you’re constantly bringing everyone around you down. It sucks. So, not only were my sad, anxiety-ridden thoughts of self loathing horribly confirmed, but the person I was closest to treated me like I was a horrible, different person while I was in an already terrible state of mind. This definitely sent me for a whirlwind. I felt as though I was making progress, but this incident pushed me what feels like a million steps backwards. It was just so humiliating; it basically sent me into a manic state, and I am so embarrassed at some of the things I remember saying. To make matters worse, I still don’t think he truly understands how much this situation affected me. I tried to have a just friends relationship with him, but I feel like I don’t even know him anymore. And the worst part is that this whole situation shattered MY psyche, not his. He is living his life as if nothing happened, but I was left to pick up the pieces of my already broken life.

Thankfully, though, these past few weeks I have been making a lot of progress. I realized I can stand on my own two feet, and that I need to surround myself with people who actually empathize and understand what I’m going through, not people who want to ignore it until resentment builds up.

So, people of this sub, I was wondering if anyone has a similar experience to mine, and how it has affected your relationships with others. And also I just wanted to say that everyone on this sub is so strong and we will all conquer our afflictions together. Thank you if you actually read all this too.",u/antiexistential,1,"Thank you so much for your kind and inspiring words. It’s hard to not get down in the dumps, but your comment helped to remind me that I’m not alone. I agree with everything you said, my only regret is not realizing it sooner. He spared his feelings, without even thinking about mine. 

I hope that everything in your life is going well too. And thank you so much for taking time out of your day to respond to my venting lol. Be strong, my fellow depression warrior &lt;3 | Thank you so much for your kind response. It is extremely comforting to know that I’m not alone with my hard experiences. I’m sorry for the experiences with your previous partners, but I am so glad that you have found someone that understands you and your illness.

u/antismiles,4,"What did I do to deserve this Everyday is the same as the last. I haven't seen a clear future for myself in years. I pushed away every guy that ever loved me. All my friends are finding love now and I'm here alone. I take everything too personally but I don't let it show. I can't go to sleep without wondering if I should just end it. But I always get stuck on how. How would I end it? I wrote my suicide notes not too long ago. Do I print them out? Do I just leave them on my phone for anyone to find? I've read posts like this for a long time wondering if I'll have to write one, and here I am. Crying for help. I can't do this alone anymore. I've tried everything. Even the bad coping mechanisms don't make the pain go away. The last time I smoked weed I ended up laying on my living room floor and crying. Cigarettes make me feel sad immediately after I smoke them. Self harm only works when I'm mad at myself or when I'm numb. Drinking has never been one of my interests so I don't even bother. What about the good? Music is bland. Writing doesn't do shit. Exercise just reminds me of how fat and pathetic I am. Watching youtube all day is aggravating. Crying it out is painful. Staying numb is the worst. But what can I do? I keep testing all of these methods. I'm just wasting my time. Waiting for a huge fuck up so I have the opportunity to end it all. I miss the feeling of actually being in love. But what's the point of loving someone else when I can barely give myself any love? So I'm done. I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna have to, but I just don't know how I'm gonna do it.",u/antismiles,1,"Thank you ❤️ | I don't know what I'm doing. The thought of having a job that I have to do every day is hard.

I might have a few friends but I'm so shy and I don't personally believe I'm attractive enough to find a partner. My personality is okay but I just can't find people who actually want to know me. What do adults even do for fun? Go clubbing? I'm scared I'm going to be that person who goes to work and comes home to nothing. That person who spends their nights getting high alone and goes back to work he next day. The person with no friends or love interest.

u/anuspounder6000,3,"Seeking advice to help my boyfriend. How can I be more supportive? My boyfriend has a long history with depression. Recently, because of COVID-19 he lost his job, moved back home with his family, applied for online jobs to no avail, and feels completely lost. Before this all started he was taking medication but I believe he ran out and can’t see his therapist. He believes he doesn’t have a future and that idea is perpetuated by his parents. 

They constantly tell him he is not good enough because he is living at home playing video games during this pandemic. He helps out a lot around the house and basically raises his two younger sisters on his own and he does much more than I’m writing here but his parents still give him a lot of shit. Between the situation with his job and the uncertainty of everything happening in the world, he has felt extra down and his depressive episodes have been really bad. He told me he had suicidal thoughts but knew he wasn’t going to act on them, but I still worry he might. I don’t know what I would do without him. 

I admit I was being selfish before tonight and was more worried about myself and his perception of me rather than focusing on him and helping him improve his mental health and that lead to a lot of miscommunication and brokenness tonight. 

My boyfriend is my best friend and he means the world to me and I have told him multiple times that I’m here for him and here to listen. I know I can’t “fix” him (not that having depression means he needs to be fixed) but I just want to know if there is anything else I can do to support him or make him feel any better. It’s hard with the situation in the world to give him hope because he feels his future is so bleak.  I just want to be there for him in any way that I can but I don’t think he is understanding that right now and is rejecting any form of help and I don’t think he reads my texts fully

I love this man with all of my heart and I don’t want him to feel this way any more. Any advice helps and thank you so much if you read all of this. I want to be there for him. To be better for him.

It means a lot | One more thing actually. Idk if you can relate to this but his parents don’t believe in mental illnesses.
