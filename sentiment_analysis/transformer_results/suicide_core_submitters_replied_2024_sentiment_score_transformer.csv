[deleted],1584,"I am paralyzed. My fiance left me. I want to die. I(28M) proposed to my fiance√©(25F) a 3 months ago. She accepted my proposal and we had our plans. Last month, I was involved in a car crash while going to work. I broke my neck as a result of the accident and I'm now a quadriplegic. I'll never be able to walk again and I have little mobility on my body. I lost independence and can't do many things on my own. My fiance√© took care of me at first for a few days, but she started becoming frustrated at taking care of me and we got into arguments. She said she didn't sign up to raise a crippled man, and that she needed a real man she could marry. She left me, and started dating another guy. I'm now being taken care of by my mother and I feel devastated my fiance√© left me. When I proposed her, we promised each other that we'd stay together no matter what, but she broke her promise. I understand why she left me, I'm just a burden and a useless crippled that can't do anything on his own. I can't work for myself or do anything on my own. I understand why someone wouldn't want to take care of someone who lacks independence. But I'm heartbroken still. I don't think I will ever find someone to marry since I doubt there will be a romantic partner who wants to take care of a crippled like me. I just want to die already, I'm living on a useless body. My mother doesn't want me to die, but I can't take this suffering anymore.",[deleted],6,"How was OP able to type out this post? | I am really sorry.¬† The best I can come up with is that you found out what kind of person she was before you married her; it would have been worse to find out after you were married.¬† But I know that' no comfort.¬† I wish I had something good to say. | Good men for good women relax | Even if you loved her let‚Äôs her go it‚Äôs shit behavior from her side. It‚Äôs not you fault friend you can still live and have life. I don‚Äôt know if it helps but you are not the only one who got crippled, I got crippled to by doctors and can‚Äôt get a diagnosis. We must be strong man no choice. | One life lesson for men, no matter age or situation, rich or poor, black Asian or white, religious or not m never throwaway your life over a woman. It hurts at first but with time you'll realise she isn't and never was worth it | Sorry to say this. But dating someone that soon after a proposal... it wasn't going to work out. Theres no way that she just moves on and dates someone else only because of the accident. It def was already a thought in her head. Hopefully only a thought. | I'm in the same position. I'm not a quadriplegic, but I have an amputated leg and incontinence issues. My mom doesn't want me to die either. But I can't lay in bed and watch TV for 50 years. I'm 38 years old, so that's about how long I will be alive. I plan on taking my own life in a month or two. But if you're looking to find some hope, there's a YouTube channel I watch called Roll with Cole & Charisma. It's about a quadriplegic who found love with his wife and somehow found happiness again. I mean honestly, I could date the guy who is also an amputee that lives in my building. But I don't think finding a partner is going to make me want to stick around anyway. The movie Me Before You gives the opposite of hope and is about a quadriplegic whose family helps him end his own life. So on the one hand, yes it's possible to find love and happiness again. But on the other end is if that's going to be enough for someone. Only you would be able to answer that.¬† | One of my best friends is‚Äùsuper-dave‚Äù bc Hes a quad that overcame his accident. ¬†It‚Äôs shitty. ¬†He made me an advocate for sci | That's harsh. But don't think that being able to do things abled people do or having a romantic partner is the only thing that matter in life.

Your still young. You can't know for sure what life will be about | Good lord. My asshole mother told me not to dive into the shallow end. ¬†She was a pt. ¬†Died of cancer. ¬†One way or another¬† | I require a lot of care and I lack independence. I don't think I can find a woman who is ok with my condition. I'm a burden. | My injury is permanent, there's nothing I can do. I still miss my fiance√©. I loved her. | It can get better but I‚Äôm in no position to judge¬† | [deleted] | Attention, sympathy, and maybe even money. People enjoy taking advantage of these schemes. | But how would OP be able to login to reddit amd hold.his phone ?? | That's not actually one of the love languages lol | Maybe his mom (caregiver) is typing it for him | Oh well I didn't mean to be offensive thank you so much for letting me know. That makes a lot more sense. I wish op the best of luck | Your most precious memories of her only lives within you. They'll be gone out of this universe with you.

I was in a very similar position few years back but I pushed through because I wanted my memories of her to exist little longer. It might not make sense to other people, but I'm sure you know what exactly it means. Nothing else in this entire universe captured beauty of her and her very existence like I did. I wanted to keep them alive as much as I could. This world is little more beautiful with her memories. | Wow.¬† An awful lot of the replies to this post break rules of this sub. | I get that it is tough. My wife of nearly 30 years divorced me, and that was tough enough.

Not sure what to say, other than that there are still people worth loving here. But I can't blame you for not being in that mindset. It was an enormous loss for you. | What a terrible day for rain. | I'm sorry.¬† Whatever choice you feel the need to make will be the right choice. | It's interesting how that got voted down.¬† I guess it's true how many people respond here to make *themselves* feel better, rather than help someone else. | His wife dying is a ""good opportunity""?  Not a helpful comment. | ""She would want you to stay here.""


It doesn't feel even the tiniest bit arrogant to you to assert that about someone you don't know?¬† You may be 100% correct; but how do you know? | Yeah that phrase is stupid, because suicide is literally the only permanent decision you can make, literally everything else in life is temporary. I personally interpret it as someone telling me that like 5 days before I die of old age I'll finally won't be mentally ill anymore. | It's a terrible phrase.¬† It is tremendously dismissive of the difficulties people can face in life to simply say ""meh, that's a temporary problem.""


A lot of people I've loved are gone from this life forever.¬† Someone who tells me that my grief is ""a temporary problem"" is a fucking scumbag. | It's absolutely not a temporary problem for some of us. And if it is its only because death is an option | Ayo i told my therapist that if all else fails its my backup planüòç | Problems are temporary because everybody dies sooner or later. | [deleted] | Well, living inherently is a temporary concept. | Yeah I understand but by this logic this is still temporary because you could accept them. But anyways suicide would help everyone honestly. | Well logically all problem are temporary cause you can just accept and endure the problem even if you don't put a solution on it, the solution is acceptance. But anyways suicide is better. | What I just said or suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem? | Why? | Hope for what | You don't get it | I am still here cause I can't handle pain so I am trying to find a accessible way to die that looks as painless and fast as a shotgun | [deleted] | I'm sorry.¬† I feel you. | No no in the ""suicide permanent for temporary problems"" their solutions is acceptance not death. | wouldn't matter most insurance won't pay out for suicides, especially if its within 5-6 months of getting it. you need a myriad of tests and therapy sessions to prove that you tried to get better to even have a slim chance for it to payout to the beneficiary. | How?? No matter how I distract myself I always think about it | Huh 15 why | Yes, I believe so too, I am just talking for the sentence, acceptance won't change anything | hell of a waiting period to end it all. | i was too paralyzed to even do something i cant believe it happened im shaking | My ex wife raped me when I was in a disassociate state a few years ago. It‚Äôs pretty much destroyed my ability to love and trust others. | My dear...I'm so sorry this happened to you. Please try to find a way to report her. Otherwise, she will keep doing this to other innocent people and cause the same trauma she caused you. Don't take your life. Help exists. There has to be some way she can be reported. I don't think she should be allowed to get away with what she did. | i wasnt raped(i was 10f) but touched inappropriately and froze, its not your fault and you not dirty, men can get SA‚Äôd its just not as common.. still does happen just goes unreported. Dont take your life. talk to someone, if they reject you then fuck them and get professional help. your not dirty. your not ugly. and its not ur fault, its ok to cry, but not to take your life. someone before told me this, i can‚Äôt remember it exactly but takinng your life would mean that they still have control over you. no you. take control of yourself and stop letting them control you. and i believe you btw, im so sorry this happened. get help and stay safe | I believe you. Just because men are the usual perpetrators of rape, even to other men, it doesn‚Äôt mean that a woman can‚Äôt do the exact same thing. It‚Äôs really hard on guys when it happens, especially if a woman did it, it can feel emasculating and people say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a guy, you should‚Äôve liked it‚Äù. I‚Äôm really sorry this happened, it wasn‚Äôt your fault | I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you, sending you many wishes, please stay to see how better life can get, I know it will take time but I just know everything will get better soon ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π | I was SAed not by a woman but two older boys when I was 9. I felt helpless and it has left me damaged in more ways than I understood until recently but life goes on and you can get over it. No matter what anyone says, it‚Äôs not your fault. Even if no one understands what you went through and people will not, they will may be act like they do but they will not; you will get through this. Please don‚Äôt do anything, I have contemplated dying so many times but there is always something to hold on to. Please think about things that matter and the life that lies ahead. | We really need to talk more about this. Society always wants to paint the picture that only women get raped but it's obviously not true. Everyone who has been a victim of rape regardless of sex needs to be heard and supported. | [deleted] | [deleted] | I feel like It's just a smoke screen to distract people and make them feel like the government cares when it's more about criminalization and eugenics | Yes, therapy in the USA is very white/capitalist centric. To assume that the problems lie within the person and ignore the rampant causes of injustice/discrimination/racism are just a myth or something. Just name some colors and sounds and you will be fine... You don't have to react to it!!!¬† Effective for perpetuating complacency | [deleted] | [deleted] | You have to trust me when I say this as someone who has gone through something similar enough: at that age your brain is still developing and it's perfectly natural to feel confused at this stage and it's REALLY REALLY NOT YOUR FAULT for having these kinds of thoughts. It's your trauma doing tricks on you. It's your unprocessed trauma that's lowering your self-value. Rape, sexual assault or any kind of bodily violation will one way or another make you FEEL absolutely worthless even if that doesn't make it true. You've got to stay strong and believe in yourself by believing me when I say that reclaiming your body is possible with time, patience and care. My heart goes out to you. | Yes it‚Äôs a risk I wouldn‚Äôt take just keep it in your head and move on | There haven‚Äôt really been much consequences for my actions tbh | I appreciate what you‚Äôre saying but isn‚Äôt that innocence is meant to go gradually yk?

Not all at once in a day.

I would have had all my adulthood to no longer be innocent.

Couldn‚Äôt the first chunk of my life just be calm? Have time to live the life of a child. Focus on children‚Äôs things rather than sex and fear. 

Most of later teens and adult life are those things. So why couldn‚Äôt I just have had time before then? | I‚Äôm not sure what exactly EMDR is could you explain it? :) | [deleted] | I'm also 17, that sounds so scary, im so sorry and i wish i could hug you and comfort you right now. | [deleted] | [deleted] | I'm sorry you freaked out. I've never attempted with a firearm so I can't say I understand the situation as well, but I'm sure it's stressful. I can't say why you're still alive, but maybe your subconscious made a good choice. Or it didn't. Who knows. Hopefully your situation improves from here. | I feel the same honestly¬† | I feel like shit¬† | Upvote for giving sensible advice. 

Just a quick note for anyone reading I used to work in my country's crisis team (suicide prevention team basically). Met many many sad cases of usually teens and young adults who thought they could escape their pain with painkillers like paracetamol. Usually the person doesn't take enough to die, instead they suffer, greatly. And if they do take enough to die, they'll still suffer greatly, can take days. Its horrible. I've seen it. I had to resign after 6 months on that team, I had a breakdown/burnout whatever. I was only 23 and woefully ill-equipped to really do much other than hold their hand. Those memories are burned into my brain. 

I have to be careful what I say but just know overdose on paracetamol or ibuprofen is really really not the option to pick out all the various options... | P.s my advice is not for you sensible person it's for anyone reading thinking about the pills plus alcohol route I know I don't need to explain to you. | Why is this being down voted its the most sensible suggestion OP is seventeen and trying to kill themselves for goodness sake he clearly needs help like actual help. I don't get it. When I was suicidal it was because I had untreated bipolar disorder what if OP has a medical condition causing them to feel this way?! 

OP if you read this believe me I've been close to walking out into my garden and eating everything poisonous literally the only thing that stopped me was seeing a psychiatrist and getting treated. Two years no depression now and I am so so glad I didn't die. 

Its worth a go right? At least hang on until you're an adult and can make your own decisions, earn enough money to be independent, you might meet the love of your life. You might find your life's passion. 

I was abused (don't want to go into details) for years from childhood and teenage years and I wanted to die every day. My mental health situation is a combo of Dissocociative Disorder PTSD Bipolar OCD. 

Then I was old enough to escape, then I got help from a doc, then I got treated, then I started therapy, then I met the love of my life. 

There's still options to try. | You're trying to frighten a very vulnerable 17 year old young person with religion and hellfire bullshit are you serious honestly üòí | F off. Idiot. | First off, don't make them feel like they should be alive for other people. Secondly, uh... Yeah, no, that's a guilt trip. I'm not encouraging suicide but I'll be damned if someone is being shamed for feeling this way. Don't be like that | No, it's the only gun I could buy since it could be delivered to my house. It's not legally a firearm. FYI FUCKING ASSHOLE. If you aren't going to help, leave. I see your subscribed to Am I The Asshole. Well, you can EXPLAIN THIS, and you will get a single definitive answer, you ignorant cunt. | Sorry | [deleted] | Yeah, I got the measure of this sub, I think. It's like trying to shout through a gale force wind of bollocks. 

I really genuinely hope OP is feeling better and/or getting some decent help. | I do apologise if my preference to shorten the word FUCK to F upset you.

FUCK OFF. 

Better?? | [deleted] | I have a tattoo of Sublime because they truly saved my life with their music. | You got this!! | I have to be in order to survive. Without parents by my side I have no other option | [deleted] | I tried od but thank god it didnt work. You dont realize you much you dont want it until its happened | üíØ | Well In my very short life ive been thru more things than my little undeveloped brain can even process so. | Things have been perfectly fine so far but if anything happens ilk get checked out | ods dont work as often as you think. not to mention, wether you succeed or not, they are VERY messy and require lots of clean up. trust me, you dont want to be waking up covered in weird colored vomit with piss and shit in your pants. | I dont know what I used I just grabbed a few things from my med cabinet. But ig they werent very affective | Please give the time to process what happened. It‚Äôs hard to see someone you love doing something like this. They are woried, they‚Äôll be back when they are ready | You have not lost anyone. These things are hard for some people to process. They just need a minute. | People can take it very personally when someone close to them even expresses a will to die, much less attempts.

They can see it as a manipulation, they can see it as selfishness, they can see it as a lot of things.  They can be traumatized.  Fear can kick in.  Fight or flight can kick in.  It's an emotional roller coaster for them, and many just seem to want to get off it, and disconnect from you.  Some may stick around for a little while, but, if you don't get better, they'll tend to drift away as well.

It really is a lot to ask of people when you think about it.  I've been on both sides of it myself, having loved ones attempt, some friends die from suicide, and, currently, struggling to get through each day and night after multiple attempts -- losing essentially everyone and everything in the process.

I feel terrible what I've put the people around me through, but I also feel terrible for them leaving me when I'm lowest, somehow pulling me even lower.  It's really shitty.  I'm so sorry you're going through this. | Of all the ways you could do it,  stabbing yourself sound horrible | The only decision i‚Äôve made is checking myself into hospital today. Or at least i‚Äôm gonna try | i really hope so. thank you | I get where you‚Äôre coming from. I‚Äôm mad at them and can‚Äôt help it. But I understand why they‚Äôre acting this way. Yet just because I understand doesn‚Äôt make it any less hurtful | I really hope so. They‚Äôre the best people i‚Äôve ever had in my life. I don‚Äôt want to lose that because I did something stupid | That‚Äôs not my problem. My problem is i‚Äôve tried to reach out and got nothing. I want to fix things. That‚Äôs all I want to do. | Oh don‚Äôt worry! I wasn‚Äôt doing it to get a reaction! I was doing it because I wanted to kill myself! I‚Äôm well aware my actions have effects on others, and I want to make things right. I haven‚Äôt exactly had a chance.    
I completely understand how they feel. But even just a ‚ÄúHey hope you‚Äôre okay‚Äù would be something. I‚Äôm not looking for a solution from these people. A professional is the only one that can do that. Just. Just someone I trust to say everything will be okay. | I think you‚Äôre right. fuck | this is really sad and i don‚Äôt think it was all your fault. kids SHOULD NOT be viewing material like that. i did and i was a fucked up, hyper sexual kid. i hope things get better and you get away from this woman. it‚Äôs her fault, mostly | damn boi your story is insane as hell | [deleted] | my sister doesn‚Äôt know about it and doesn‚Äôt remember it | thank you‚ù§Ô∏è | [deleted] | idk but my mom has been a real AH lately even outside of this incident | Couldn‚Äôt agree more. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs keeping alive rn to be honest | Damn .... Me too. | when i was younger i always felt this same empty feeling, but it wasn't suicidal thoughts. then at around 12 it started. I find that strange | exactly( it's like you gotta pull back after impulsively taking a few random meds because you know it's most likely not gonna work | I feel you. | glad i could find people that relate too | that's nice, i started taking an antidepressant a few days ago, small dosage, hopefully as i up it it goes away. and happy cake day by the way | i completely share the sentiment. feels like a little devil on my shoulder¬† | dont be like jeremy wade delle | Preach. | I hate that for me the idea of defending myself makes me want to be here less. I'm not fearless enough to face death myself but rather too cowardly to face life.

Any suggestions? üòÖ | [deleted] | Sounds terrible man, your life is worth something believe me. Keep your head up I guarantee you there will be a time where you can depend on people missing you. Be kind on yourself. It‚Äôs really easy to forget that. | I hope to die soon, I'm glad no one would care after a few days | How are you doing?? Please reply to this bro, we care about you | Anyone able to trace their IP and call someone??! | i love you. talk to me | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | I already shot myself in the shoulder and it's hard to lift up my device to even type. I'm still alive but I can f | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | I find it sweet that some cis women can relate with their body dysmphoria. Feels like we are not too different, and we both struggle with body image. | Stop being on tttt for starters, you just posted you hate ""cissoids"" just after posting here | Not all women have a high or feminine voice, not all women are hourglass shaped or have big boobs, not all women have small shoulders. Im sorry that disphoria makes you feel that way about yourself but remember there are many different types of women. Lots of my female friends also dont feel feminine enough. Learn how to do make up, different hair styles and outfits and you‚Äòll feel better !! üíï | From one Chloe to another, I understand where you're coming from. It's hard to beat dysphoria and the transphobic political landscape and social media definitely doesn't help. At least you're on HRT I'll need to wait 3 or 4 more years, and being on HRT is better than not. If you aren't already, try some facial skincare if you aren't, it slightly alleviates my dysphoria and it might help you :) | I'm so sorry this is affecting you so deeply. I don't have any advice except to recommend going to a therapist.

Im a woman and I really hate my body. I don't like to look at photos of me and I tell others not to take a pic with me in it.

I hate how overweight I am. I hate my brow lines and I HATE that I get so much chin hair that I could puck 20 at a time. one time I plucked 70 hairs because I missed 2 days.

I don't know how to help. I know what its like tovlook in the mirror and feel disgust | Hey there, im sorry that youre feeling so dark and wounded right now, i know that a lotnof times it can feel like a platitude when people try to cheer you up or offer unsolicited advice, i dont know you or your boundaries but i do hope that this helps you the way it did me, im not religious but the sentiment meant a lot, ""god made trans peoplenfor the same reason they made wheat and not bread and grapes and not wine, to witness transformation is divine"" nobody has to set your pace but you, you dont have to 180 and like eberything about yourself, but try to start with neutrality, then see what you can agree with, move slowly, you got this girl üíú | Don‚Äôt worry, I was born a woman and I still get mistaken as a trans woman all the time because my body is built like yours chin up lady. things will get better. | Love, you are perfect the way you are. Everyone has unique things about them (good and bad)! You shouldn‚Äôt have to compare yourself and I‚Äôm sorry that you do. Dysphoria and body dysmorphia are fucking killers. If it‚Äôs any consultation OP I bet you‚Äôre a beautiful, feminine woman even though you don‚Äôt believe it. And I‚Äôm proud of you for finding your identity although it may be hard. | [deleted] | [deleted] | oh my sweet girl, stay strong. all is not lost, it will get betterü§û | axiomatic rotten long physical plate telephone fretful serious observation possessive

Your body does not define you; your mind and personality do! No matter what you go through, the people who love and support you will be right beside you! Never think you are alone or that no one cares! You aren't a monster; you just have to try to love yourself more!  I know what its like too!

Two of the comments below this post are transphobic. It feels like you can't leave trans subs without at least one cis person calling you a slur. I obviously don't hate all cis people. That is why I like tttt it is a great place to vent frustration without being harassed. | Trans solidarity. At least we are suffering the same thing together and it is comforting at least not to be alone | Frankly, I wanna write a lengthy letter to the developer to make the gender dlc more accessible because this is ridiculous | Omg another chloe Hi :D | I think a trachal shave can make your voice sound more feminine | I wish ffs was cheap but sadly it is expensive. But I'll take your suggestion and try a different style | Idk I love /tttt/ feel like a good place to vent my frustrations with being trans. I've been practicing with voice training, and I'm going to practice more with some more cheap makeup until i get really good . It is hard, though, to make the right steps while trapped in boymode | Yeah | I gave being a man a chance, and I almost killed myself, so I don't think that works, but okay | Idk, even so most of comments are positive
Fuck haters | üíØüíØ | Yeah, you may be right | Because I am? | I don't want to be a man, I want to be a woman, but I am frustrated people don't see me that way | Nothing I just don't want to be a man | [deleted] | love she knows and this has been a very long battle. i am very exhausted and tired | i was gonna do it on the 5th and then 10th and now now the 15th. idk why the 5's but here i am. im here end the endless cycle im going through. one second im good the next im bad. theres nothing else. ill be gone in an hr | i am very sorry for the late reply. i took myself out to the fields but there was a birthday party going on two three house down. i couldnt ruin it for them so i took myself to the er. they just gave me a drip and asked me some questions. i just got home. im still numb. thank you for your kind words | i am very sorry for the late reply. i took myself out to the fields but there was a birthday party going on two three house down. i couldnt ruin it for them so i took myself to the er. they just gave me a drip and asked me some questions. i just got home. im still numb. thank you for your kind words | im 23. i am very sorry for the late reply. i took myself out to the fields but there was a birthday party going on two three house down. i couldnt ruin it for them so i took myself to the er. they just gave me a drip and asked me some questions. i just got home. im still numb. thank you for your kind words | it was a very hard decision for me to make and thanks to a stupid birthday party im still here | theres no prize for being resillent | this thread is my making me cry so so much thank you for your kind words | thanks love ! | thank you love ü§çü§çü§ç | i just got back from the hospital well technically ish. ill say i just got back home. thank you for your kind words. ive tried alot of medication and therapy love. ive tried everything | ive been like this since i was 5. im 23 now. i kept the hope that it will get better one day and it hasnt | i am very sorry for the late reply. i took myself out to the fields but there was a birthday party going on two three house down. i couldnt ruin it for them so i took myself to the er. they just gave me a drip and asked me some questions. i just got home. im still numb. thank you for your kind words | again im very very deeply sorry for worring random strangers. it wasnt my intention i genuinely was gonna leave last night and just had to say something. used reddit as my outlet | i dont have it in me man i really dont | i dont have friends anymore nor the money to socialize at the moment. it's a very difficult situation rn for me | you are correct love. i am very sorry for the late reply. i took myself out to the fields but there was a birthday party going on two three house down. i couldnt ruin it for them so i took myself to the er. they just gave me a drip and asked me some questions. i just got home. im still numb. thank you for your kind words | thank you so so much but love i just feel really really numb | thank you but no ü§ç | years lol. i dont mean to be condescending but its been a very very difficult joinery | Props to you that you could handle life for 60 years.

I‚Äôm half your age and I can‚Äôt imagine making it that far. I hope whatever path you choose you have good luck | [deleted] | [deleted] | It's sucked for the vast majority of those 60 years.¬† But feeling cheated by that fact is apparently indicative of a problem with me. | I'm sorry. | Same :( | I kept thinking ""surely this stuff won't keep happening.""¬† But I was wrong. | Thanks. | Brief periods in which I actually did feel loved for a while. | I am glad that that's close enough to what you want to help you. | I'm sorry you feel that way too. | Thank you. | For a lot of people, it does come true.¬† But also, for a lot of people, it doesn‚Äôt.


And why didn't it?¬† Because I suck in some way that prevented it?¬† Because of some personal flaws?¬† Almost certainly, yes.¬† I wish when I was 3-4 that they would have just told me ""yes, the abuse isn't fair, it's not right, I'm sorry"" rather than tell me it would get better soon and suggest that eventually someone would actually fill the role of parents for me, neither of which ever happened.¬† I wish when the bullying got really brutal, I wasn't punished by the school for standing up for myself the one time the odds were 1-on-1, and I wish the school didn't tell me that being stripped naked and being thrown outside or having bags of urine poured on me or being beaten bloody once a week was just kid games and would get better.¬† I wish when I was 10 and my best friend was killed, my elders would have simply said ""I'm sorry, this is awful and it's not right"", rather than tell me it was a freak event and wouldn't happen again, which turned out to be wrong, actually.¬† I wish that when I went decade after decade after deade of no women in my life wanting to be close to me either as friends or as romantic partners, my other friends hadn't said ""hey, don't worry, it's just a blip, it'll **definitely** get better"" only to change their tune decades later and tell me that it's unrealistic of me to expect those things to get better now that I'm older, sorry you didn't get to experience those things when you were younger like we did, sucks to be you, but too late now.¬† I wish that when depression removed my ability to actually do the career I'd spent my entire life, back to childhood, pursuing and dreaming about, forcing me to permanently give it up, my friends hadn't told me ""it'll get better, if you work hard on the depression, you'll feel better and then you'll find something else.""¬† God how I wish they hadn't said that.


I wish they'd simply sympathized.¬† Or, if not that, I wish they'd simply helped me die a long, long time ago. | Yeah, it's maddening to be told that I have to stay around to avoid hurting others -- the implication, of course, being that their pain matters, and mine does not. | Of course, your psychiatrist is right in that quote.¬† But why does that even need to be said?¬† What really pisses me off about a quote like that is that it seems to suggest that the patient (you) is looking for things to be *perfect*.¬† Yeah, no shit Sherlock, life isn't fair, I'm well aware.¬† But life being unfair doesn't mean it has to comprehensively suck.¬† That's a false dichotomy.¬† It can't be perfect, so you should just accept awful?¬† Fuck that shit. | That's what the point of the antidepressants has seemed to me to be.¬† They've always either (most commonly) done nothing (except bad side effects) **or** made me just not care about anything at all, good or bad, so I didn't care about the bad shit so much because I didn't care period.¬† I'm not a fan of that route, but I'm getting a **lot** of pressure to embrace it. | I'm sorry.¬† I can't promise that it will for you; but I do hope it does. | Thank you. | Sometimes I think it's someone who genuinely does want to help, but has no idea what to say, and that's what they come up with.¬† I just wish they understood the damage they can cause. | ""Hypocritical people in my ear"" -- sometimes it feels like a fabulously rich person standing over a hungry destitute person lying on the sidewalk and telling them that money isn't important.


When it comes to ""doing things myself,"" the problem, for me, is that the only stuff I still care about is stuff that's not under my control.¬† Even if I can find the wherewithal to work at it, I can do my best to make things better and it doesn't matter because I can't change others or the rest of the world. | For both of us. | Thanks. | I'm sorry.¬† I hope at least a day can bring you something good -- if not today, then tomorrow.¬† Just one day amidst all the awful. | I'm so sorry.¬† I wish I had something good to say. | Well said.¬† I'm sorry you're fighting all this too. | I'm sorry.¬† I don't know if Tx resistant depression is an official diagnosis, but it seems a fair description forbme as well, in that I started therapy at an absurdly young age and anti-depressants almost as young, and since then have been under such care much more often than not, and yet I've never been free of the depression.¬† Sometimes I see stuff suggesting that ketamine has been working surprisingly well for folks with Tx resistant depression; but that's something else I'm not allowed to do.¬† But you might look into it.


My parents are both long gone -- my dad died 24 years ago, and my mom 43 years ago -- but my feelings are pretty conflicted about them because my mom had significant mental illness and did some horrible things to me, while my dad basically refused to see it.¬†I had 4 siblings, but can't really blame them now because the one that was an abuser (independently of my mother) is dead, as is another one that I had a difficult relationship with.¬† The two that are still alive are the two I arguably got along with best.¬† But I do resent my oldest living sibling right now, through no fault of her own, because she has developed Alzheimers and needs my help, and the need/sense of duty to help her removes my freedom to end things.¬† Even if I wasn't intending to commit suicide, the knowledge that that was an option, that I had that escape route, was some comfort.¬† Instead now I feel trapped.


As for the poor sleep, maybe you've considered this, but you might look at your mattress.¬† We got a new mattress almost four months ago and it's been a revelation. | Thank you.¬† I can't go out and hang with people now because when I'm not working, I'm a caregiver for an immediate family member with Alzheimers. | Thank you. | I can't abandon my sister with Alzheimers to a state facility or something. | Thank you; but if I'm honest, that thought doesn't make me feel better right now.¬† I wish it did, but it doesn't.¬† The pain is too significant. | How?


I've seen a fair number of near death experiences in real life (from back when I was a first responder).¬† I don't know that it's done much for my mood . . . | I have no plans.¬† My plan since last November was to give myself through this past February to find some hope -- things didn't have to get better, they just had to seem like they *could conceivably* get better -- but that didn't work out.¬† So then I switched to plan B, 'try to get over my fear of a suicide method leaving me still alive but in a worse place than where I already am, like paralyzed or wiith brain damage or a dead liver or something.¬† But my sister's rapid onset dementia, and the help she's needed for that, threw all my plans in the trash.¬† I have no plans now.¬† Which drives me nuts.


I am sorry you're struggling.¬† It really really sucks. | It's personal.¬† I think it *does* get better for some people.¬† It just doesn't for others.¬† And for those of us for whom it doesn't, we're left wondering what's so fucked up about us that it never did.¬† It's a bad thing to say to people. | Thank you.¬† I'm really sorry you're hurting.¬† I wish I had something good to say.


For all the losses in my life, whether the loss of a person or a relationship or a dream or a pet or anything else, the only thing that ever really helped was some other thing to be excited about and focus on.¬† That doesn't happen any more. | I'm sorry. | That's an interesting idea.¬† But for reasons I can't get into on Reddit, it's not an option for me.¬† It would have practical consequences for me that it would not have for others, and unfortunately that's as far as I really can go. | Many people suffer worse depression from cannabis usage. Alcohol too. 

Exercise, sun and nature are the best natural choices. | Sorry you feel that way as well. | Lots of things happened.¬† And I just don't have any hope in me anymore that the things I care the most about can change.¬† Especially when they involve factors that are out of my control.


Of course, mention that too loudly, and someone comes along and spouts the platitude that our happiness should only depend on things that are under our control.¬† But while that's great as an ideal, it falls down in the real world.¬† We are always beset by stuff outside our control, and some of them are not to be shrugged off even with strong effort.¬† Go up to someone living in a war zone who lost their family when a shell hit their kitchen, and tell them in their grief that they should focus on what's under their control.¬† Just try it.¬† The only question will be how hard they'll hit you, and rightly so. | People will say that if you find a job you love, it won't feel like work.¬† Ok.¬† But what if there's nothing you love? | Thank you for the kind words. | I wouldn't say ""it doesn't get better.""¬† Whether it will or won't is too dependent on the person.¬† It just didn't for me.¬† That doesn't mean that it won't for anyone else.¬† I have no idea. | I'm sorry.¬† The only thing I can say that's any good is that everything varies from person to person.¬† Maybe for you it *will* get better.¬† I don't know. | Well, I want to make clear:¬† I wrote about me, and not necessarily anyone else.¬† I have seen life get better for friends who were in a lot of pain.¬† I've just seen it not get better for some, too, including me.¬† I have no idea whether it ever will for you.¬† I hope so.¬† But my post wasn't meant to say ""**you're** fucked.""¬† Just ""**I'm** fucked.""¬† Whether you are as well, I don't know.


I do hope things go better for you. | I did.¬† I ended up committed to a mental hospital at 17 after a failed suicide attempt.


I hope you're able to find some peace. | In the end, if what you need to be happy involves other people, your chances at even just contentedness, let alone happiness, are going to be a lot worse.¬† I know this.¬† But I am just not willing to accept how this life of mine has gone, let alone more of it as is.¬† I don't want it.¬† If there existed a mechanism for me to give it to someone else who has unjustly lost theirs, I would do so and be truly happy for the chance to do something good with mine. | Am there, doing that.¬† I'm sorry you've been thrown that line too. | I'm not so worried about something bad after death.¬† But I *am* terrified of some method I use hurting a lot, or of it leaving me badly fucked up but still alive, so my life is even worse than it was before. | Nothing.¬† I know this sounds awful, but one of the things I lost with depression was the desire to do much of anything.¬† If I had all the money I could ever need and therefore no need to work, and thus could do whatever I wanted . . .I can't come up with anything.¬† There used to be things I wanted to do, but there isn't any more.


The other impediment is that there are people who depend on me who I cannot abandon.¬† In addition to my day job, which I can't quit unless I want to sell our house and put my wife out on the street, when I am not working, I am helping to provide care for my sister with Alzheimers, and I can't abandon her either. | I felt the same way at 15.¬† What happened then was a few good things and many bad things.¬† I wish I had some kind of wisdom from that experience that I could pass on so that yoi'd be more able to avoid the bad shit, or see it differently, or *something*; but I have nothing.¬† I'm sorry. | I'm sorry.¬† I do have work, but I'm terrified of getting fired over how undependable I am now. | Thank you.¬† Honestly I've always felt that any time I ended it would be super lame -- just not as lame as each day feeling like I'm being waterboarded and having hot pokers applied to the soles of my feet. | Thank you.¬† I'm sorry for you too.¬† So often it's the hope that it won't always be like this that gets you through; and as you say, when that hope is gone, what do you do? | Yeah.¬† You figure it's a big world with a lot of lives in it, and some of those lives are unlucky.¬† That's just the the dice roll.¬† But none of us gain anything from people lying to try to make me feel better and then telling me I'm being unrealistic when hoping for things to turn around this late.¬† Shoulda just let me die 43 years ago.


I'm so sorry you're in this pit too. | Thank you.¬† Today was no better, really, but I didn't have as much free time today to dwell on the things that make me wish I was dead.¬† So maybe it was better in that regard. | I understand.¬† Sorry. | Fair enough.¬† I just didn't/don't want anyone else to conclude that their life is useless based on me. | Sorry.¬† Was not trying to make anyone sad.¬† Just screaming because I am in pain. | Allie Brosh.¬† Yeah, her comics meant to describe depression were absolutely brilliant. | The one thing I can say is that when you're older, you have a little bit more ability to choose your own course.¬† That doesn't mean things will be good; but good or bad, at least it's less likely to be because some elder made you do it. | Understood.¬† My ""hobbies"" don't bring me even a fraction of the joy they used to (and I had someone tell me this very week that that proves my problem is really just myself, rather than the pain being too much as I think).¬† But I still keep at them.¬† I'm glad you're able to take a little bit of solace in yours. | It seems excessive, but if it works for you, fine by me. | I spent most of it in tears.¬† So, not so good.¬† Sorry. | The problem for me is that it's not just depression.¬† There is not simply a biochemical issue to solve.¬† There are tangible, identifiable things that are wrong that I'm not going to be able to be happy until those things are made right.¬† But they can't be made right. | The only effect I've ever had from psycho-active medications (and I've taken dozens of them over the decades), other than bad side effects, has been making me not care anymore.¬† I didn't feel bad, I didn't feel good, I just didn't care about the bad shit/issues I was unhappy with.¬† I actively, aggressively, do not want that to happen again.¬† I would much rather be dead.¬† **Much**. | So, when you said that ""medications can help make tough issues more manageable,"" my immediate reaction is ""no,"" because in my experience the only way they make tough issues more manageable is by making me not care, and I do not want that.


If the things that seem to me to be missing from my life cannot be there for me, I'm not interested in sticking around.¬† If the drugs offer a solution by making me not care about those things, I actively don't want that solution. | Is it possible to escape from you to escape safely from your country? | idk man.. try to leave to Poland by any means necessary if you feel you have absolutely no other option left. Hopefully, the war ends soon. 

I saw those videos where guys get taken forcefully by those guys in vans. Its not good. | I do not want to come off as insensitive. Atp I'm just brainstorming. Is there a way to hide or disguise yourself? Maybe there are a few people who could help you hide. I know it's very risky and that there are probably Ukrainians against it. | Cant you desert and go to jail?

Im just curious | Thank you so much. Reading this felt so good after 15 bots messaging me. It feels good to just be seen and heard in any capacity by someone else.
And I definitely will try to avoid the worst possible outcome, I will only resort to suicide if there is nothing left as an option.
Thank you for your care, have an awesome day. ‚ô•Ô∏è | They have dedicated a lot of resources to prevent that. | Conscription age is 25, Yes. I'm not planning on killing myself until I'm at least close to that age, should be enough time to figure out how to have a dignified end | we don't know that for sure. if he's unlucky he'll be sent to the most risky fronts. | Men aged 18-60 are banned from leaving the country. And I am not going to flee illegally | [deleted] | [deleted] | Man, I understand. I'm 40 now, and I was adopted when I was 8. Before that, I was born to an alcoholic father who went to prison for killing a dude with a hammer on a drug deal gone bad. My bio mom would fuck anything that walked to keep a roof over her head. The one she stayed with used to beat me and my brother and sister with a 2√ó4 with nails sticking out of it. I'm the oldest (>8 at the time), my brother was 5, and my sister was barely 2. When we finally got pulled by the state, my sister almost died from being beaten so bad. She was literally blue and purple. We were beaten for looking at the toys under the Christmas tree one year because my grandmother brought us a few things so we wouldn't have nothing. Oh, I also got beaten again because she didn't bring anything for the guys' kids. When we got pulled out by CPS, I had a broken right arm and leg from where the dude picked me up by then and slung me into a wall. It was a fucked up childhood that affected me for many years.  So, I def understand abusive parents. Even my adoptive parents were with their right wing, extremist Christian beliefs. To the point that I hated myself because nothing I ever did and every emotion I ever had was never godly enough. All that being said, I overcame it and used it as an example of how not to be as a person or parent. My kid is a wonderful, happy, healthy, and kind kid. A beast on the football field but not an asshole jock. He'll literally be the kids who sits with the kid who has no one to sit with. Why? I taught him how to be a good person. I turned my pain into progress. I feel like it's a testament to my character. Don't let your parents' failures become your own. You can find that last ounce strength to go on, to go hard, and to beat what's been done to you. I understand loneliness. Hell, every woman I was ever with before my wife cheated on me. I felt like there was no one for me, and I almost took the same path you're facing down now. I felt utterly hopeless. I kept on going, and eventually, without warning, I met my wife by chance. I felt happiness again, and I feel so blessed that I didn't give up because I look at my life now. All the things I have to be happy about. A beautiful wife and child. Now, I'd never give my life up unless it was to save theirs. Life comes in waves, and some of them are pretty rough and can be hella intense and last a long time. If you push through it, though, you'll be amazed at what it can bring. I hope you read this, and it strikes a chord with you. I hope it can help you see past these hard moments and give you hope in the future. You deserve it just like all of us do, and I hope you stick around to see it. Good luck, my friend! | You sound insanely awesome | I love you bro! You have plenty of life left. The things you're experiencing would make you a phenomenal parent. You've seen the downside of being treated poorly, and that gives you insight on how NOT to raise your children. Make a difference bro, you been through hell and won. Wear that shit proudly and keep moving forward. | I plan to lad | Nothing has meaning. I've been wanting to kill myself for a long time now bro and I'm done | Thanks man. I won't stick around much longer but thanks | I'm just tired of living out of spite and anger. I'm tired of being strong. When I kill myself I can finally be put to rest. | I'm not suicidal but This is such a beautiful and uplifting answer! And I needed to hear this today. Thank you on behalf of everyone here ‚ù§Ô∏è | I don't know if I have OCD but living is suffering. Every day of this shit life is just nonstop pain and suffering and never gets better. Being autistic makes it even harder for me. I'm going to kill myself to end this. | Sorry about your son. Really. But I can't suffer like this anymore. This torture is too much | I'm genuinely lonely. I have nobody. But I'll die peacefully which is what I want and thank you for kindness | Dying is my only resort brother. It's easy for me to pass away. Done all of that | LOL | Without the shadow of a doubt | This is a pretty disgusting thing to say to a suicidal person. That the decision to take their own life is selfish, because you imply the consequences should remind one to think of their actions rather than actually empathise with someone. You're selfish just by saying this, and moreso because you assume the repercussions are something I have NOT thought about. | I am forever grateful for the little things every day and express positivity, optimism go out of my way to compliment strangers, to uplift others, to give happiness to someone in genuine need. Hope is all around us, but I can't see it in myself which is why I must kill myself and will no doubt kill myself. Nothing can save me from the severe suffering and burden of living every day | Am not British, am Irish lad | But if suffering builds character, why am I still suffering? What's the point in living if I'm constantly lonely and always suffering? I don't want to keep being strong. I'm in pain. I'm going to kill myself to end this very soon. | Not possible | I don't care. There's nothing in death. Nothing of anything. And that's better than being miserable and alone for the lifetime I've lived | yeah sure | I'm sorry bro | Dude you aren't gonna believe this but I'm allergic lmao | He saw my profile and knows I'm autistic and Irish. Just a meetup in my capital in March | [deleted] | It doesn't even I don't feel meaning. I feel misery. I feel hopeless. I am going to kill myself to ease this pain | God hasn't brought me happiness. God has made my life needlessly miserable. God has literally forsaken me to a life of loneliness and suffering. Why is it the shitty, disgusting get to live good lives whilst children die of cancer, that there's literal insects that burrow within the eyes of people and eat outwards to sustain themselves? If there is a God I don't want to pray to this egomaniac who makes life difficult for people without a single fucking reason. | It makes me sad when I see someone else who suffers because of their loneliness. You don't deserve this. Even moreso considering you tried to comfort me. | I have done this and continue to do so. It's not enough. I need to die to stop this suffering but thanks again. | Not gonna lie, the fact that my death will torture him is seriously motivating me. Lmao. | I'm not going to be able to do any of this. I'm just so tired I've exhausted my ability to enjoy anything. Every day is just constant suffering and misery. It's like I'm just putting a stop to my own pain | I'm going to do some things to enjoy myself before I die. Or try to. I don't enjoy anything anymore. So I'll give this one last shot | [deleted] | I've suffered my whole life. There's no meaning to suffering if I'm just constantly suffering and in pain. Every breath is pain. Every thought is horror etched on the traumatic memories that leave me shattered like broken glass. Suicide is the only way to relieve this. I'm giving myself a release. | Even with all that in mind, I'm suffering. I'm in severe mental and physical pain. I'm so tired and the only thing that brings me energy is the fact that I'm going to kill myself, but thank you for trying. | Thanks for your kind words. I'm just done being strong and fighting this. It's all exhausting. All misery. I'm going to die to end this fucking disgusting shitshow of life. | I'm not going to live for an abuser who may love me. I'm not going to live for anyone who may or may not do anything. I'm going to kill myself to save myself the suffering of living | I've literally tried so many things and every attempt to better my life has just set me to square one and crushed me. I honestly don't know. I'm not capable of being happy. | [deleted] | Because you shouldn't have to suffer to enjoy life. | In this economy it's literally impossible. No chance of it happening. I'm trapped. And anywhere I go, I'm just constantly miserable and sad. | That wouldn't help the fact that I'm stuck at home with a terrible piece of shit. It doesn't fix my broken past and will never fix my attempts to better myself. Medication can often just make you more suicidal and I see this as pointless. I'm going to kill myself either way. | I'm not saying that bro. I'm saying endless suffering is pointless | It could just make my life worse. That's not something I'm interested in. And I can't escape this home. I literally can't. Rent in Ireland is disgusting and discriminates against all who wish to live any life whatsoever. | Because there's no joy or satisfaction to life | Yeah. He knows I'm suicidal. | Honestly it doesn't get better but you can make it less painful via meds and finances that's all I got for ya ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Do you honestly want to get better or have you just given up? | [deleted] | Are you actively trying to change how you feel like you mention loneliness are you actively going out to meet new people or just sitting back waiting for it to get better sonehow. If the people around you don't like you need to branch put to new people not wait on the same people to suddenly change for you.

Being depressed and suicidal isn't something that can be gotten over and people here agreeing saying it can't are just being stupid about it. You need to change something or this horrible life that you say you have just continues 

You need to change to have a better life | [deleted] | I appreciate your support man. | I feel the same way man. | You gave a pretty good answer. Goes to show how detached people really are from the minds of suicidal people. | I just want to kill myself so badly | I'm sorry you lost your brother. I see you, too. | Thank you. | Am trying. As for meds, they don't work and I've been refused them which does not help either. | I feel like I'm giving up every day. Doesn't mean I don't want to get better. It's just so hard. | lonely forever, mental anguish from child abuse and a breakup from an abusive ex | In your mind is there anyway or anything that could possibly make things better achievable or not? | [deleted] | Change doesn't promise anything? If your at the point where you want to die every single day change should be your only option not going straight to death | So what's the plan then don't change and just die | Me too. | Ideated since I was 12 

Fully suicidal for a year | You didnt prove anything whatsover? You just made a meaningless statement ""changing doesn't promise anything"", if you are unhappy and want to be happy and you don't change anything then guess what? You are going to remain unhappy. The only solution is to change something unless you want to remain the same. | Change is not impossible it just seems it which is the whole point. I don't belive anything like suicide is selfish, the disease if a selfish one because people cannot see past themselves | I'm alive. I haven't done it yet. Sorry for worrying you all | From one human being to another I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è | please stay | [deleted] | You there OP? I hope you're ok. | Please be okay | I couldn't hang myself, so I've taken myself to the edge of a river instead | I know things must be so hard on you. I understand that anyone can be brought to this point. Know you are loved. Life is stupid, unfair, and quite frankly bullshit sometimes. Try to live right here in the moment and try to find some reason for being. We are all here for you. I am sorry you are going through this¬† | Take the noose away from your neck and step down from that chair, please. 

Take the time to get some sleep, I promise it will be ok | OP, I don't know what magic words can help you, but please, stay just 1 week, 1 more day, anything. Please, If you take action, things WILL get better. thats what I would tell myself months ago, on the brink of suicide. | I really hope ur happier there than here. | Please hold on. | I really hope you're okay üíî 
If you ever want to talk, I'm here to listen. | Yep | Thanks :) | Yeah I've been standing on the chair :( I don't want to get help because I hated being on a psych ward because it made me worse | The fact you can't do it, the fact you are pleading on Reddit for someone to talk you out of it, proves that there is a doubtful yet hopeful part of you. A part that doubts you 100000% wish to take your life and hopes maybe life can be lived. Life can indeed be lived.

For I know the plans I have for you,‚Äù declares the LORD, ‚Äúplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.

The hope within you is God. Do not lose Him. | Please don't do it. | Oh | Yeah its really for attention. I love feeling so bad that I put nooses round my neck, and take myself to rivers. I love feeling like nobody cares. I love feeling defeated every single day. If only I had killed myself properly one of those times, so that it was real and not for attention right? | You described my mother | [deleted] | I don't have health as well | What illness? | You will die before you find it | it‚Äôs called empathy and community. try getting some | My skin (literally my back, shoulders, chest and face) are all permanently scarred from acne. I can definitely relate.

But, your average person is worrying about their own insecurities to notice the flaws of others. And a large portion genuinely don't care about aesthetic appearance. Don't waste your life homie. | There has to be surgeries to ‚Äúhide‚Äù those scars. Man, I think therapy would work wonders for you. | definitely understand the pain, i have been riddled with acne everywhere. i also have a horrible sick picking habit which has resulted in me going to the doctors twice because i got and abscess on my back and one on my face, both scarred because of it. i keep being told to stop picking but i couldn't stop. i am and was insecure about my appearance, i always have scars on my face and in other places due to that. i cant say i do relate completely with the extent you have acne, but you aren't alone with just hating this part of you.  you have spent so much on just this that you feel like you're in ruins and shambles, eventually there will be a moment where you can be able to just live with this. maybe still hate your appearance, but you might be able to eventually find that its really who you are that matters most, cheesy i know. online people are more likely to see you for who you are rather than your looks. you are still a great person im sure underneath it all. at the end of the day we are all made of bones and flesh, we are all made of the same things, we all want approval we all want to be loved and accepted. you are and you can be, theres definitely more out there that is worth going on for | based + in swear the comments under this post are the most mindblowingly stupid shit ive ever seen. i always say ill kms ""tomorrow"" or ""next week"" (it never happens, something always has to happen, whether its good or bad). you were fucked over by shit medical healthcare, you experienced a fucked up childhood, yet you're still expected to be happy, crack on with life and not feel like this? the way people view mental health problems (including professionals) is still so incredibly myopic, despite the amount of scientific research we have. and props to you for surviving such a shit experience and managing to pull yourself together. i hope you're okay and maybe you manage to get back up and yell fuck you in the face of everyone and everything that did you wrong | Bro don‚Äôt give into despair. Why? You think that you‚Äôre acne is a huge issue it‚Äôs not bro. There‚Äôs many things wrong with this world and many things trouble the world, but you my guys are not anything like that. I don‚Äôt assume you have all the answers but one things for sure you can‚Äôt just assume everything wrong with you when there‚Äôs not. So you got acne? So does everyone in one point in the life. So you got debt? So does everyone too. You‚Äôre not alone in this world bro but never give up without a fight. So get the fuck up and pump your chest out. Walk away from your problem and find solutions. Good luck | I could care less about what another person thinks of me. I don't like it, and to waste so much time and money for nothing is what was my last straw. | Yup your right. I have no joy or happiness left. And I'm good with that. | From the past. To my skin. To my money, to everything. I just hate everything. That simple. | At the end of the day, it was a waste. Cause if it wasn't I wouldn't have made this point to begin with. | I'm not sure where you see carrot tops face look like what your describing | There's someone here who spent 100k. I'm aware it's a lot. | Trust I tried every treatment there is. | That's for acne. Not scarring | Acne scars. Not acne | Soaps can't remove holes, but bumps It can. | I don't like pets. | Tf? Are you dumb, or just a bitch? I should've been dead a long time ago for what I went through not only because of my skin. And if you could read it's acne scars, not acne. | I can't believe you said that.op needs support and not someone to insult him.he needs people to STOP being judgmental....btw....sometimes the problem goes deeper but you don't care enough to ask and instead tell them to""grow up""? Wtf?! | What bill? | [deleted] | Nothing financially about your situation isn't something you can't recover from. Trust me. You're not alone in your experience. You'll pull through. | Not a treatment per se to deal with the scars, but re shape the way you think and feel about them.

Either way, I‚Äôm so sorry you feel that way. | Still op. What‚Äôs the difference between them both. If both affect one‚Äôs appearance and confidence. I get ya bro you‚Äôre insecure, but so is everyone else. Trust me literally everyone because even the people that look perfect are insecure. Why? Two reasons I believe 1/if someone is prideful usually they‚Äôre insecure of being insecure. 2/they‚Äôre insecure that they might not meet standards so they‚Äôre naturally insecure. So technically everyone is insecure and you shouldn‚Äôt be tripping on anyone but yourself. Just try to be the best you can be and walk in the path god intend you to. | I used to care deeply. But over these past weeks, I'm starting to care less about what others think. How I view myself though hasn't changed and won't change. I guess cause I got used to being isolated, and don't want to experience any type of joy idk. | I'm aware I'm not alone. I mean there's a whole sub dedicated towards this. I just don't wanna live with this. Simple. | Cause I was trying to treat it since I wasnt aware it was permanent at the time‚Ä¶ | I struggled with mental problems for over 10 years. It doesn't get better. Cause when it does another problem arrives. I'm aware we‚Äôre all going in to die but why not speed the process up | ? I tried every drugstore product, prescribed products, etc. I don't have acne. I have acne scars. Soap can't magically fill in scars. If it could, everyone dealing with this would have done it. 
Effort? So me flying to multiple states wasting money on  procedures, hotel stays, and trips isn't effort? wasting money on every cleanser, moisturizer, serum, retinoid, sunscreen, and exfoliation wasn't effort? 
When I said 50k i meant only on in office treatments. If we are talking in general from plane tickets, hotel stays, every drugstore product used, prescriped products that wasn't covered with insurance‚Ä¶.. Then i would've written more then 50k. Mess with me with that. | Yes they do | You don't know my life | the follow up: tALk tO uR fAMiLy aBOut iT | I dont allow  myself to be happy. I don't fear it | Drew a Picasso- Drake

I have more but that's what Ive been currently listening to.

I'm aware it's my choice and I feel comfort in my decision | üòÇ | Dont apologize. You just don't know what I went through. | Haven't felt happy or joy in a really long time until I tried therapy and started doing fun things that brought Me joy. Then Life Gave me this shit when I felt like my depression is over. Then today I lost my grandmother. So basically why live? | 03 adolescence, and amari | Many people think they see results from trestmens cause of microswelling. I did a combination of subcision, microneedling (PrP and RF), different types of lasers (erbium, CO2, Fraxel, ablative, full field, etc), TCA cross/peel, phenol peel, dermabrasion, chemical peels, etc. Filler felt weird and made me look different in a bad way‚Ä¶. So yeah all of that and only 20% improvement. And I did multiple rounds of each. Scarring Is hard to trust and is permanent. If someone like you judged my skin i wouldn't gaf. I just don't like them on myself. | Thank you. Her funeral is scheduled for next week. Sorry for the loss of your dog. They're with you | 87. She lived a great life. We already knew her time was coming since she was getting really sick. I'm just done with life. After her funeral, I'm done for sure | Your welcome | Nope I'm done for sure. Fuck I look like forcing myself to live all because lifes a bitch. I'm tired of these dark times that don't seem to fade ever. When I thought it was getting better boom this happened, now my grandmothers gone. Fuck that | There should be a way for people like us to die painlessly. Humanity keeps pretending it cares about life but it needs to take a good long look in a mirror. You care about life but make us disabled ugly people feel like we don't belong? I wish humans would just come out and be honest. Humans want people like us to die. So they won't have to see us anymore. So they don't have to keep saying ""you're not mc type"" on dating apps. Or ""you're not who we're looking for"" on job boards. I would have ended my life years ago if we had an actual suicide system. | :( you probably aren‚Äôt ugly or a freak, there‚Äôs someone out there for everybody, even you! | There was an episode of The Orville where an alien species said on her planet everyone had the right to suicide because none of us consented to being here and if it's their will not to live, so be it. It was one of the most beautiful portrayals. | I'm 32 and I'm almost confident there's nothing I can do at this point. Life ended ages ago (if you could call it a life) and I'm just living for nothing except misery.¬† | I used to enjoy those same things actually. I was much happier as a child before i began to feel attracted to women. Sometimes i feel like maybe being chemically castrated would help me feel a bit better. I don't know why nature would create an ugly autistic male and make him attracted to the opposite sex. It's like a cruel joke. 

I'd probably still be depressed though. I don't get any enjoyment from those old things anymore. The excitement and enthusiasm has gone. It all feels meaningless. That's probably why i wish i could just socialise and date instead. That sort of stuff would feel 100x better than some pointless nerdy hobbies that don't bring joy anymore. | I haven't felt joy for years. It's all ruined by the constant feeling of being a freak. When there's no joy to be had then there's not much point being alive. It's like a prison and I want out.¬† | [deleted] | When you're not good enough for any woman because you're a freak you do start to feel some resentment. When i see women in public i just think about how i should keep my head down and not look in her direction because of what an ugly freak i am. I've been bullied by girls before for the autism and told i didn't need to do sex education because i'd never have it. So, i do feel resentment towards women... but i know it's my fault for being ugly looking, short, and autistic. Women naturally want a good looking normal male. It is what it is.

I find that feminism has made man hating almost virtuous now so i can't say i like it. There's a reason why so many disenfranchised men are now listening to people like Andrew Tate. Personally i don't listen to him because i know nothing can save me. He's just making money off of desperate men who still think there's a chance. Me disliking feminism is like how women naturally dislike Tate. I think it would be psychotic for me to expect people to support and like an ideology that actively promotes hate towards themselves. I know i'm viewed as shit by a lot of feminists because of how i was born. Well, i hate myself too. Is that what they want?

No i don't think the government should provide me with a sex slave. Why would you ask such a question? Just because i'm an incel doesn't mean i think humans should be enslaved. I'd rather be a normal male so i can be loved the normal way. Most incels are normal men who are unfortunately unable to the live up to the standards that women want from a man. We're failures and have to live with the fact we're failures. The world has made it clear i'm filth. You can contribute and tell me i'm garbage too if you want. The fact you are more concerned with my views on women than me feeling suicidal shows how i don't really matter. If the government should provide me with anything i think it should be a pain free suicide method instead. Do you support that? | [deleted] | You can't stop being an incel. It literally means Involuntarily Celibate. I'm too ugly and autistic to attract women. I'm like 5'7"" and got a disgusting face. I can go years using dating apps and not even get a date. 

I know you'll say looks don't matter to women at all but looks do matter with attraction. I'm too ugly. I'm a joke of a male. | Involuntarily Celibate. I think eventually you become bitter towards women because you know you're not good enough for any of them. But i know it's ultimately my fault for being born the wrong way. I feel this immense pressure to be this ideal man that women are naturally attracted to. The problem is, i'm 5'7"" autistic, have an ugly face, and i can't even build muscle after 2 fucking years of gym. That makes me feel like a complete joke and i cannot live with this horrible feeling. I don't want to be me anymore. When gym. healthy eating, and hard work doesn't do a single thing, you start to accept that suicide is probably the only answer. 

I don't blame women for all my problems. I blame being ugly and autistic for all of my problems. Women naturally just avoid freaks because that's sadly how nature works. I'm a defect. | I don't recall the name, but it was after Isaac committed suicide and the scene is when Lt. Malloy's rolling around in bed with an alien chick. The loss of Isaac is still dividing the crew on their feelings towards him, but Malloy genuinely misses him and talks about it briefly. That's when she goes on to say on her planet everyone has the choice. Malloy got upset at her being ""insensitive"" is pretty much what I can remember. Hope that helps. | The chance of surviving and being much much worse off scares me. That's why i wish assisted suicide was a thing. It just seems inhumane to force people to continue living when there really is nothing ahead except pain. There are painless ways to die but has to be done just right. I think it involves removing oxygen and you just simply fall unconscious and your body starts to shut down. Something peaceful like that is what i'd like. I can't count how many times i've said ""I just want to sleep and never wake up"" | I've pretty much concluded that love doesn't exist. Love is very conditional... which isn't love. Relationships are more like business transactions. And the world of business is brutal because if you don't have the goods you'll go out of business. Seeing as how i have no chance out there i genuinely feel like suicide is the only answer. Why keep someone alive when life is just one constant pain?? | [deleted] | I'm not sure. Depends what you define as an ugly woman. What are the features that make a woman ugly looking in your opinion? I'll tell you if I've dated that sort of woman in the past.¬† | So you're asking if I date women who are conventionally attractive or do I date women who are conventionally ugly?¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†


What does a conventionally ugly woman look like? I'll answer if I've dated her. Who I've tried to date might or might not be considered conventionally attractive by others.¬†


I'll ask you a question. Do you date people who you don't feel attracted to at all? Do you think people should date someone who they think ""yeah, my partner is hideous and I don't feel attracted to them at all""¬†


No one owes anyone anything. And I will never expect women to date an ugly autistic freak like me. But I AM entitled to feel upset by the situation. As would anyone who is forced into inceldom. It's my fault for being short, ugly, autistic, unmasculine, and all the other things women naturally avoid.¬† | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | So you want the world to change because you feel too exhausted/see no reason to change yourself? 
Correct me if I'm wrong. | Last time I made a post people tried giving me‚Äùadvice‚Äù but it was really just mocking and playing the morally superior hero, all we want is for people to KNOW not looking for a reason not to do it. | I appreciate it, but it is literally impossible for me to do anything | What we only know for sure is that after we Die our consciousness will cease to exist. 
We will probably lose these opportunities to experience and explore many great things in this world and life forever if we k_ll ourselves.

But I fear the possibility of regret prolonging this life If in the future after all those efforts of making myself better fall apart. 

But at least I did my best , At least I tried 
noh?

 It's hard to decide.üòî | If I tell you, you won‚Äôt take anything I said seriously. | I was in a mood, and I didn‚Äôt think anybody would see this | Vent | I don‚Äôt want to have useless medication that does literally nothing but make me want to vomit and these stupid therapists that are just telling me things about myself that I already know, how fucking stupid is it that I am paying someone to listen to my problems? | Vent | Vent | You don‚Äôt know that. You are just saying that to try and make me feel better, and I appreciate it but I literally have nothing to live for. Things I‚Äôm interested in aren‚Äôt skills or talents, it is just rotting in my bed and going on this stupid app. | It doesn't really help how therapists profit the longer you're mentally unwell. And medication has different effects for different people... Yeah... I totally understand. It all seems so absurd and rigged. | You'd be surprised how young the posters are. Suffering is a language that's unbound by age. | I‚Äôm 14F | No, and I don‚Äôt normally vent, it makes me cringe. I was just in a shit mood when I made this post and didn‚Äôt except anybody to see it | In this sub, people will treat you seriously, regardless of your age. 15M btw | I also started getting depressed when I was 13. I always feel like I'm just a spectator of this body.
I'm always bored and feel like everyone is just a nuisance. I'm alone most of the time while I watch others with their groups. I'm always labeled as the most silent person in the room, I'm not good at academics and I just play videogames when I'm at home even though I don't like home because I can't get along with my two sisters.
I think it's not that I struggle socializing, It's just that I Can't find most of whom I met interesting. 

Those days are so alone and boring and pressuring.
I have a lot of regrets that time

I'm now 21 years old and I'm still depressed and I did not apply for the 2nd year of my engineering course,
then 2 years ago My GF (my only one friend for 5 years), we broke up and I still cant move on. I think my brain can't process that she's already a different person now. 

I can't find a job and I'm so depressed now
I want to end all of these that I feel everyday. I want to erase my memories and start again somewhere far away from this place. | It‚Äôs almost impossible to care about someone through a screen but this is actually really thoughtful, Thank you for putting in your time to type all of this, I‚Äôm sorry if I came off rude in the original post, I was in a mood | I‚Äôm unstable: no kids. Easy. | While I agree, it makes me devastated. I would want nothing more than to because a mom and give my children the care and love I wish I had growing up, yet I know I have serious condition and I‚Äôm terrified of it causing them trauma. | It‚Äôs none of your buisness to tell others if they should have kids or not. | Yeah I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever have kids, not that it would matter I can‚Äôt even get a girl to look at me. | I do | I think some people should but a lot shouldn‚Äôt | Never plan to | Please hold off, call a suicide hotline and speak to them.

I just read your post and I'm feeling very sad for all what you are struggling. You're very young, but people managed to cause a so terrible damage in your mind, I'm so sorry. | Dude dont do it i know a crazy horror thing that can happen | Please take things slow, suicide is a permenant solution to a temporary problem, I'm here, sometimes talking can help so much.

Most of the people in America will be dead before the end of the decade cause of their ignorance. 

Stick around so you can laugh in their faces when it all falls apart. It‚Äôs gonna be hilarious.

I can‚Äôt decide if it‚Äôll be more entertaining to watch the hope drain from the Christians or the hubris drain from the 1%. Both will be well worth all the suffering. | [deleted] | It‚Äôs not, I love him a whole lot. I‚Äôm just a self isolating person. If I could break up with him, I would. To punish myself, to isolate so I can die in peace without hurting someone. I have BPD, so one minute I hate him but the next I love him. We work on this feeling daily, he knows how I feel. There are so many reasons I stay with him, the reason I want to break up is so he doesn‚Äôt suffer with me. | I can relate to how you're feeling. | [deleted] | Agree, except this yr I won't be here for my bday. | Life's so cruel I guess, I've stopped living since more than 5 years, I just think about when it will end. Sometimes I think people who choose to follow their plan are stronger than me as I can't do it. I just have to survive until I die naturally. I really feel lonely. | [deleted] | [deleted] | Yeah.The brief pleasure of an orgasm and then you remember life sucks the rest of the time.
I hate myself for being too much of a pussy to end it.
I sometimes wish I could die radndomly or something. | I don't drink or do any drugs coz I tried that once amd it just made me feel like shit after still. | [deleted] | [deleted] | How did it go down? Did you tell them in person? Or was it over the phone? I just want to know the context | I'm glad you said former best friend. What friend encourages their friend's boyfriend to leave them while they are feeling suicidal? | It was over the phone. They didn't even tell me they were going to call the police. They juat did it behind my back | Like after the conversation? | Average reddit experience | Fuck around and find out | Just as a side note, I am not here to take pity or be coddled. I posted this to get it off my chest in hopes of some advice or potential secondary thoughts. | I hope everything worked out for this guy. | You do NOT deserve to go to prison, you did NOT do anything wrong, and you DEFINITELY DO NOT DESERVE TO BE REGISTERED!! You DO need to scrutinize what you're putting on your device though. | Without getting into all the specifics. Youthful Offender was denied, and according to most of the legal professionals I've consulted, my state only has to prove I had them in my possession and accidental acquisition is not (usually) considered. In my state Registration is 100% mandated for life so I have to move to a state that has a tier system. We have defenses but it will only be able to lessen my sentencing¬† | [deleted] | I uphold my own innocence, for what it's worth. Although, as far as the dates the files were accessed, that has not been provided to my knowledge.

However, if I continue, I have plans in place to move and to lawyer up | I really do appreciate the kind words, but I don't want to entirely paint this as if I was a saint. While yes, I know that I am not a predator and that I simply didn't know what I had got into; it was my own incompetence and carelessness that allowed something like this to be perpetuated through me. It's part of why my guilt haunts me. I do not want to paint people who are trying to prevent the abuse of children as ""dumbasses"" even if my situation is unfair. Perhaps, the system of punishment needs to be fixed but that topic isn't why I posted this. | Yeah officer this comment right here | This exactly. And if CP ‚Äúaccidently‚Äù got into his files, how extreme is the porn he‚Äôs looking at in the first place that he has to save it into his computer, instead of browsing your average porn site? All of this is worrying and suspicious. No wonder he deleted his account. | Why do you want someone who is potentially innocent of child porn charges to be charged with child porn?

As a survivor of incest, child porn, international child porn, incestual rape, all before I was nine years old, I would never want someone who was innocent doing these things to be on the registry. It just dilutes the effect because people look at the circumstances and go, ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs not too bad.‚Äù

Real predators and offenders are the ones who need to be on the registry. And I think that most people who are victims, or who, as I like to class, myself are fucking survivors of child rape would agree that they want the bad people on the registry, not people who have made a stupid mistake. | [deleted] | Asshole | Fucking nuts. I unfortunately had a porn addiction and never EVER saw any of that shit. My god these people are into messed up stuff. | OK, you obviously have no filters, and as I am a survivor of child porn, which you may be too, I will be gentle.  

There are often people who send files to other people, containing child porn, that the sender hopes that the recipient will download those files.    

Then they call the cops on the recipient for having child porn. These files can be embedded in other innocuous messages such as ‚Äúhave you renewed your car warranty?‚Äú

Until someone is proven to actually have child porn for the purpose of sexual gratification, I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt for the simple fact that it‚Äôs too fucking easy to download child porn in this damn age if someone is out to get you. 

If you can‚Äôt understand that, then I‚Äôm sorry. Like I said, I am a survivor of a child porn ring, where my images were spread all over the world. I still don‚Äôt know to this day when I might encounter someone who looks at me and knows that I was the little girl in those videos, because I still look the same.

So if you have any empathy for survivors of sex offenders, please listen to me when I tell you that I don‚Äôt want every single person who has inadvertently downloaded an image of a minor to be on the sex offender registry. It diluted it, and it makes it a joke.    

I only want the fucking worst of the fucking worst of the worst to be on that fucking registry. And if you can‚Äôt understand that, then fuck you. | Well, obviously‚Ä¶What I was into was not extreme enough for me to ‚Äúaccidently‚Äù come across CP, though. | Understandable, as someone who also suffers from suicidal thoughts, we can empathize more than most.

But let‚Äôs be honest here, you don‚Äôt accidentally download child porn onto your files. What you are saying you do when you come across CP, is way different to his situation. It‚Äôs also textbook excuses for pedophiles. | Just save up enough and go be a monk in the Thai forest tradition. | No and no. Sorry to offend you. Much love üôè‚ù§Ô∏è | It's an alternative lifestyle and path for people who realize that there is no way to find true happiness through the conventional routes. So you renounce the material existence and go train your mind in the monastery. | And if you can't find it will you be more sad or happy? | Okay so is it a state of equanimity or suffering? | It's okay it's just word you haven't encountered yet, you're not stupid you're learning.

Does your experience of ""not feeling anything"" still contain suffering or is it pleasant? | Yes I've been there and I would agree. Through my experience and observation of others even once you get the job and house the suffering doesn't really end. You just get a new set of problems.

This is why I gave my initial suggestion of exploring the monk life, and consider what would make someone want to pursue that lifestyle?

That being said there are many paths and I sincerely hope you can take your path day by day and grow into a beautiful flower from all this manure around you. ‚ù§Ô∏è | Don‚Äôt do it | Your friend probably didn‚Äôt know what to say.. I know mine didn‚Äôt.. as for here; you‚Äôll have people who will talk and help. dont go near the noose just yet please. | That is not a friend. I'm so sorry | This right here. We live in a society of people unequipped to deal with it. | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | That is a creative idea ,I write poems, and that's what I do... but it's not enough. Nothing is enough! Nothing will make me feel like I can continue living. I have violated since a young age. I have to study for grade 12 and not fail ,I have to continue living when my body isn't even mine OR THEIRS anymore. I can't!! I can't accept any of that!!!!!!! I just can't live anymore!!!! And for lifes sake, I can't go to therapy either or online or anything . I am just looking for a way to die, and I am VERY SORRY if I sound hopeless. I'm sorry but I tried .and I'm tired | No, there's no help available and that's why I'm on reddit.. | But they're well and alive and still doing their dirty work elsewhere...might as well save myself | I am sorry English isn't my first language and I am having a hard time understanding those phrases 

But from what I got ,yes ofcourse we want to be heard but because being heard didn't do me any different ,I decided to go on reddit, maybe I'll find a simple way to die.
I love being human, because I love so much I got deeply wounded , I have been wronged and used as an object before the age of 10 that and excluding the normal life pressure ,abuse and etc...

When I could no longer bury my wounds ,when talking was useless and writing was tiring ,when noone including myself could hold me up anymore ,I decided to come here .

And you don't love me ,you don't know me to love me...

And thank you for saying I'm a good human being, but I'm hurt! I am deeply hurt! And I don't want to continue this life no matter how much I want to so bad ,I can't let myself continue to get hurt.

Do you understand? | Thank you...but I don't think so,  atleast not where I live . Everytime I go for relaxing walks ,I also meet men that are there sa LIKE CANT WE ALL JUST GO ON NORMAL WALKS open street ,and everything. I have lost hope. Now I'm just looking for a way to kill myself | No I would rather die | And what made you leave? | Without hope | Then, by all means, do so 

I, on the other hand, do not want to be a man. Men hurt me enough for me to never wish ti's upon myself.

If you feel like you hate being a man and you have found by professional help that being a woman makes you better 

Then get a doctor to sign some papers and transition since it's very common either way | I do not want to be a man , and I hate being a woman. And I hate the men that have caused me to hate being myself .why would I turn to someone I hate.. | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | Thank you...I don't know why but you saying how I should have unconditional love for myself made me cry....... | Thank you | Tell me the fastest way to die, I ain't got no money to afford going to hospitals again | I am not comfortable with hugs anymore haha....

I have been working on my mental health for years and I feel like this runs deep...I don't know how to be me again .normal.happy. 

Unwillingly remember.....I'm not gonna mention it again... guess nothing will change if I do or don't | The thing is, those men over here do this in pure daylight.


And I really don't care if I look defeated because I'm not. I've kept myself alive for 8 years after the very first incident.  So ...what else is there to see when everywhere has ppl that'll attack you for the sake of their own trauma that I do not Care about cuz I'm traumtized and don't go out actin like them | I'm happy to hear that! And I'm sorry about your backstory.


But I don't have the money nor am I in the country that let's me own a house. | You could've just become the man you never had in your life instead of transitioning your trauma away (if that's bot the case, ignore what I wrote, please) 

And 2. Some women can't have children too ,if yiu were born a woman ,you'd starve yourself for the sake of acceptance ,neglected by your family if you had a brother or if not actually , you'd do many things that cab eventually not let you have kids 

3. Horrible men are horrible to everyone ,you are not messing out .

4. Being a woman is special but pain, and that's why I would rather die than be born in pain again

Good luck with you | More than any literal child could process. More than any adult could bare...
And I bieleve I have every right to rest! | [deleted] | Okay I'll check it out .thank you | What's worse is it killing myself or is getting into another incident involving projection and objectifying me and worse 

All those things are much worse than death and I bieleve death can save me from this. | I agree 

And I can, but here you aren't allowed to work until you're in college ,you are looked down upon more like they will hurt and many women get sa and ....yk my trauma is more than enough for  a weak person like myself and as much as it hurts to admit I'm sure India is bad for women as much as my own country . I really dont know 


And I have myself taken jobs to work, and it still wouldn't be enough to even buy myself the meals for the full weak.
But I guess I could gather up the courage, but.....I don't know.


But thank you | Firstly, I'm sorry if my direct way sounded unsupportive to you ,I'll try to do better 

Secondly ,I know men go through shit, but my post wasn't about how women have it worse than men (which in some cases .....) but it was about how i can't handle the cases women have to go through

I don't know why you turned this into competition it was never that.

I hope you find whatever help you need, but this seems to have taken a bad turn | I actually enjoyed being a woman what I don't enjoy is the sexual abuse I went through for simply being born a woman 

Well....what can I say.

I hope we all find peace | [deleted] | [deleted] | Shit I‚Äôd still rather be alive now. Compared to literally any other time in history‚Ä¶. | Just try to enjoy the little/everyday things. Ignorance can truly be a bliss sometimes | Oh there‚Äôs a punchline, it‚Äôs death | That‚Äôs an interesting perspective about art that I‚Äôve never really considered. | Okay please don't do this.  I'm sorry for whatever has you feeing this is the right course of action, but it's not.  What's going on, do you need to talk, can I help? | Talk to us man. Those people are fake, we're not. We'll listen. | I hope you're okay | [deleted] | Religion is meant to explain the things science can‚Äôt, like what happens when we die, when during pregnancy and childbirth do we get a soul, is the universe alive, and what are we supposed to be doing with our sapience? It‚Äôs not supposed to be a cure-all and it‚Äôs a mental framework that doesn‚Äôt resonate with everyone. | I kind of envy people who have convinced themselves there's some higher being because it's a convenient lie to believe in. On the other hand I fucking hate religion. If there is a god I refuse to worship him anyway fuck him. | it's super annoying ""god loves you"" I don't! it's crazy how people expect everybody to believe in a 'god' | They're not trying to make you believe or anything. Unless if they actually, that's really annoying. But people just sharing random things about the Lord and also some nice verses and stuff, it's actually a good thing. They don't mean any harm, they just want to wish you well. They try to comfort you in a way they can. It's kinda silly for a stranger to act like a best friend all of a sudden. These simple techniques would help them get to you and let you know all they want is peace for you. | [deleted] | At least they are trying to say that they care about you | You have to let go of the specifics. They mean well, probably. It's the best you can hope for. | I too agreed with this for the longest time. But at the end of the day when you‚Äôve got nothing to hope for its nice to just think that someone out there has your back | finally someone smart. i‚Äôve also noticed that religion is just a child‚Äôs story turned into a full on delusion for a coping mechanism. we‚Äôre alone in this universe and we gotta accept it, if aliens exist they will stay far away from us because of how dumb we are as a species | Yeah i know I didn‚Äôt mean abt those who say they‚Äôll pray for me, thats nice of them although not helpful. But yeah what i was referring to is the people who say stuff like ‚Äúyou should start praying to jesus‚Äù ‚Äúhave you tried going to church?‚Äù and shit like that makes my blood boil. | [deleted] | religion is delusional copium, get good. if you need religion to be a good person you‚Äôre a bad person scared of consequence. 

if you‚Äôre really a good person, you will know what‚Äôs right and wrong and don‚Äôt care about consequence | Guys this person is crazy. They‚Äôre *transracial* | Yes it should never try to combat science because they‚Äôre attempting to explain completely different things. Science explains the physical side of the world, religion the spiritual. And when you see things that contradict science, well the people practicing the religion didn‚Äôt know the science so of course they‚Äôre going to try to explain it through spirituality | What makes you think everyone is Christian? | religion is bullshit copium and a delusion, get good | then explain to me why good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people.

explain to me how in a universe with a very clear set of laws of physics and science, a supernatural being that breaks all of those rules could exist.

explain to me how someone who was dead for 3 days, with every cell in his body completely dead and slowly rotting, suddenly can revive.

explain to me how objects without mass(souls, ghosts, etc) can exist in a universe where everything except light and gravity has mass.

i could make a whole book out of this. so just get real | You know we can document small scale evolutionary adaptation right. And science doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúthis is 100% for true what happened‚Äù it says ‚Äúbased on the evidence we have this is the most probably hypothesis that stands up to scrutiny‚Äù | the universe is massive, and the first form of life was likely very simplistic. we know it was a single celled organism meaning it was only one cell and that was the entire living being. so in simple terms, a bunch of carbon, hydrogen/water molecules, and oxygen combined and made the first cell, which then started collecting more of the stuff needed for life, which in turn created more life, and now billions of years later here you are arguing about your delusion while shitting in your toilet | May I recommend revenge? | [deleted] | Yes!!! Thisüò≠ | I‚Äôm in the psych ward right now | You don‚Äôt say shit like that to people especially when people are looking for support systems, shame on you. | That‚Äôs unnecessary | He deleted. 15 is waaaaaaaay too fucking young | He deleted his account. Is he dead? | What‚Äôs sad is all of the things he has listed could have been changed, could have changed for the better. | Oh jeez! If you are still here, you could really land your dad in some serious hot water because he didn‚Äôt secure his firearm. Heck he could end up serving 20 to life. | [deleted] | [deleted] | Alright sorry, thats what my dad does when I am sad so I thought it would work | I don't wanna assume but i think this guy didn't actually end it (hopefully not) | If u are still alive plz read this 
You are not a bad person
You and safe to be around 
I hope if you are dead already you make it to heaven or some sort of good after life | Kaja I'll miss you so much I'm so sorry I'm done with everything I'm a monster I don't deserve to live. Please don't be sad. I'm so sorry. I'm terrible I hate myself I want to kill myself in a most brutal way. I'm sorry Kaj, I'm sorry. | don't do it | [deleted] | I will remember you stranger | Idk if this is how I leave an update to this stuff. But it's too late, I appreciate everyone reaching out, I really do. And keep reaching out you will help so so many people, I'm sorry I could not have been one of them | I am so sorry that you were in so much pain that you felt like death was the only way out. Sending you loads of sunshine and brightness üîÜüîÜ | Please don't go. Please don't go. Talk to any one of us. This page is killin me, i feel hopeless as i have similar story. I don't know to help myself or anyone. Please don't go! talk to us. Anyone here!! | I mourn. It's not the right outcome, but I have no power over this. | I will call out to Jesus | Thank you, I hope the same ^^ | I'm not a good person, the people I dmd can attest to that, I have some... Issues? I suppose, but I am extremely violent and explosive, causing me to scream and hurt people over any small issue or disagreement. I can blame this on my family, as this was learned behaviour from them, but blame is still on me. I've almost stabbed many people in my life because of a rage which isn't even my own. I'm not a good person I assure you.
I'm sorry about what happened to you, and I'm so so glad your wife got the help she needed ^^ | The ""medication"" I've used plus the blood loss etc, and since I'm going to fully commit if this doesn't kill me, though because I'm so high over the lethal limit I should be good ^^
 Sadly I don't enjoy much anymore, I enjoy spending time with people, but I don't have that anymore, nor Will I have that ever again | I want it, but my family won't let me get it | I can't have a better future, I will permanently be trapped with my mother, and i will never be able to work | Thank you, I'm not dead, so I'm sorry | I can't go to hospitals, but I'm not dead, so thank you | Thank you, my mum used to sing that to me when I was a child, back when she still loved me :( | Sadly I'm not dead, so I'm sorry | I promise you, I am a horrifically terrible person, but thank you | I'm alive, regretfully. I was comotose or something similar, so I'm sorry for not replying, I'm very sorry | For me ? Using weapons to harm people can be a pointer, but not a guarantee. Purposely and accidently hurting those you love, again not a guarantee. Alot of people think I am because I'm trans so if we go by mob law, idk. I really don't know. I just feel like a bad person. Sorry | I did survive, I wish I didn't. But my life isn't that bad, people have it worse, I'm just touchy | I am yes, I'm sorry | Thank you | I'm sorry | Thank you | She is yes, she only uses me to sexually exploit me | Im not dead sorry :( i failed :( | Gonna be frank,fuck off. Half the reason I wanted to die was due to the religious shit which has fucked over my youth | Please don't leave comments like this | Why was this downvoted so much? The relaxed terminology? Could I get some insight please? | I agree, but I'm stuck, even as an adult | I've been comotose, but I'm not dead. Frankly I feel guilty about this Reddit post now... | Omg omg fckkk!!! Oh god. Thank you. Thank you for being alive. | If I get away, I'll have to work, then my life will be worse. I'm really sorry that happened to you...

My family's response is always to get violent to things, so I've picked it up, but my therapists didn't want to deal with it. I remember once my aunt attempted to throw my grandfather of a balcony over eating a cheese string. I'm sad to be like them | There's not much to share besides what in my post, my family don't even love eachother, they just argue and assualt eachother. My gf just sexually exploits me and I'm fucking tired of being a waste | All, I had a store of painkillers, opioids and more illegal substances which I all took over a lethal level | I am physically and mentally disabled, I cannot work, and most days standing up causes me extreme mental and physical pain. Someone has to take care of me, no one else is willing due to the person I am. | I promise you, I really really am, as a person I am the bottom of the barrel | My friends don't like me, I'm alone. Police wouldn't fix the situation either :( | Thanks, but anything I say would receive alot of judgement ^^ | It's fine, nothing can be done about it frankly. At least she'll be happy when I'm dead, it's something | And a good person wouldn't harm their loved ones and do terrible things | I did do it, but I'm alive. 
However, I'm sorry about your father I'm lucky I won't have to go through that pain. Is there anyone you can speak to about how you feel about his passing? | I've done all these things, I still hold some blame, especially because I'm not getting any better | i don‚Äôt. i do 7a-7p with 5 days off in a row every other week. also im in the army guard so i get to flit off to somewhere stupid to do some stupid shit with some stupid people for a weekend every month, and then come back home and get back to it. i still get bored sometimes but my set up has worked for me so far. 

i‚Äôm doing my 2 weeks of summer training right now, and yeah it‚Äôs been some hard work, but it‚Äôs also been a good break in the monotony. i‚Äôd highly recommend it if you‚Äôre not completely anti government and have somewhat of a ‚Äúfuck it we ball‚Äù mindset. | [deleted] | [deleted] | Kinda like thinking of it as if you‚Äôre serving a prison sentence? Sometimes i feel the same way. The day your get of jail is when you die | Thank u for this. May i ask what kind of sales is it? Do you have to drive or visit houses? | I am sorry | Are u in the US? I am from a third world country and they work 7 am to 5 pm there. Monday to Saturday. No breaks, only one hour lunch. Idk how they do it. Thats legit oppression and abuse. I really hope things get better there | Mine is for my loved ones but still its still so hard. | Lol. This. So true | [deleted] | Lol i had to google what ‚Äòfuck it we ball‚Äô meant. Not disappointed. | Yeah i guess being grateful that you are given a healthy body and being born in a first world country helps. I grew up in a third world country where there is not even jobs for some people. This actually helps me a bit. | This is comforting to hear | Yes this is true. It could be worse. 

I think we should strive for better life quality and work life balance. The current system doesn‚Äôt provide enough work life balance. And ppl in the third world country where i grew up in had to sacrifice their body to just live. My grandma got ill from overwork.

We should also be critical and fight the greedy people on top exploiting workers.

And btw i dont think he deserve the downvotes, i mean he aint wrong lol | You are so tough. I am doing it too right now ans i‚Äôm 25. I dont have anymore in me to show up to work. | I agree with your post. I think it's barbaric and detrimental to mental health to work forty hours a week. I have so much respect to people who can get out of bed early in the morning and work even more than that. 

But we live to cope and cope to live. No matter how ironic and pathetic. | Lol fyi your comment about ‚Äúcaptain obvious‚Äù was so funny it made me laugh for a second :D | [deleted] | Whatever creator, entity or cause of our consciousness, it doesn't care about us. The universe is chaos. And chaos is ruthless. | I am in the US now. But I grew up in Asia | Do you need a special degree for it? | Yes totally agree. | He said people aren‚Äôt human and they are robots. I said its comforting because it made me think thats kind of right. In this system we are not treated like human but robots. So i might as well shut down and not feel. That made it bearable for me. I‚Äôll just go in everyday on autopilot and i dont have to feel anything. Just do. | Thank you :) | I appreciate you both. | Retail.. it sucks. I work at walmart. | Thanks. I might look into it | üòÉ thanks | Thanks I appreciate the advice tho :) | It‚Äôs hell trying to attempt and fail I‚Äôve also tried many times I don‚Äôt understand how people succeed | I have tried to be content with my situation. It leads to extreme boredom and the loneliness doesn't get any better. | Sorry you also have to experience this. Would give anything to experience what it's like to be a normal person. | üíÄ | I am creepy for sure. People have told me I'm creepy to my face and I only realize I am acting bad after I'm told about it. | Yes. I had tried my entire life to act in a way that others find acceptable. It took over a decade to make the miserable amount of progress that I did. I never fit in, made close friends, found a relationship, or got a good job.  A single one of these would have made my life worth living. I gave up a couple years ago after a lifetime of failure. I have regressed socially to a point that I can never get better. Killing myself is much easier than spending years trying to do it all over again to most likely fail. | Possibly. I relate to a some of the issues autistic people deal with, but I was tested as a kid and was not diagnosed. | who knows at this point | Please get help immedietly | I have similar fantasies... I'm a sexual abuse survivor, so I understand the thought process. 

The rape thing especially and being beaten to death. 

I have taken medication and seen therapists, and nothing helps. I've had suicidal ideation since I was like 6, maybe younger. 

You're not alone ‚ô° | Try talking to a therapist if you haven‚Äôt already. After I was SA‚Äôd I‚Äôd get a lot of intrusive thoughts about stuff like this, especially with the being raped. I hated it, I‚Äôd be having sexual interactions and these thoughts would pop in my head, and I hated that I was physically attracted to it. Don‚Äôt feel like you are alone but please seek help. | I'm not alone | [deleted] | I already do hurt myself too much | I thought I was a freak | I get this so much... I'm so afraid to commit suicide but I often fantasize about someone just doing it for me... 

I'm sorry you're feeling this way, friend üß° | Yes I do | What do you mean I don't get it | I am not I am a 4 suicide attempts survival this isn't a joke not trying to mock anyone | Unfortunately it hasn‚Äôt completely gone away. I did talk to a therapist about the thoughts but I didn‚Äôt include the attraction to it. Honestly I‚Äôve just been trying to heal and realize that what happened to me wasn‚Äôt my fault and that I didn‚Äôt want it. I feel like maybe my body is trying to convince me that maybe if I wanted it, it wasn‚Äôt so bad. But it was bad. And I didn‚Äôt want it. No one deserves to go through those things. The more I heal from it, the less often these thoughts happen to me. But I would say it‚Äôs been almost two years so it hasn‚Äôt been easy | How to see therapist if you‚Äôre broke | There is something romantic about it for sure | I have bulimia nervosa even though I am at a healthy weight I always feel I don't deserve treatment for not being underweight | This is the internet lmaooo | 59 years old, with 55 years of being told things will get better, and most of it spent¬†working hard on the things under my control.¬† Not better.¬†¬† | It might ‚Äúget better‚Äù you never know but I can see why hearing that constantly would be frustrating. I‚Äôm here to talk if you want but I don‚Äôt know how much help I could be. | Jesus man. 55 years... How do you do it? do you have a family? | That's a tough one. Having friends would probably help, but that isn't happening. | oh I believe people love me, I just want to die anyway. Theres no feeling of ""nobody cares about me"" from me. the downs of life don't make the ups worth it to me, thats all. | nothing in particular, just realized I didn't enjoy living and my life has been on a steady decline in enjoyment since then. Not a straight line mind you, theres been ups and downs, but its like a stock graph of a company thats approaching bankruptcy. | [deleted] | I'm not sure how to answer.¬† At various times, I have had people in my life that I would call family.


I don't hold anything against people who told me it'd get better, because they meant well, AND for most people it does. | I'm extremely religious, my fear of going to hell is the only reason i'm still here. I'm not a very likable or sociable person. I also struggle to trust people, especially people I haven't met in real life. | You seem like a lovely person. You said words that comforted me so much. I really, really hope you can make it through. And are still here to read this comment because I get it and just want to say keep going bro/sis. | Plz wait talk to me first please just talk to me and give it a chance | Many people said ""yOuR fRiEnDs AnD fAmIlY"" but I alone honestly really have no one and nobody to live for... | Do you believe it now? | I‚Äôm 34 and trust me, those high schools parties (the few i bothered going to) don‚Äôt mean a damn thing to me and I NEVER think of them | imagine still living like this in ur 40s that's me | i dont have any passions and dreams since i know i wont reach them because of my health problems | there is no possible to get better im fucking failure | Have you ever think about people who are hiv positive than thank god u r not one of them plus there are people who are born with disabilities from birth i wish you are not one of them | i just cant anymore | I'd hate to see you go | [deleted] | [deleted] | Zoloft | Zoloft | Zoloft | She lives with me. She went out of the house to have lunch at her grandmother | thank you | Thank you very much. I will talk to the more understanding family members and try do contact her doctor. | it's all on planning.....

fuck nvm I was just getting sad becuase my family and basically everything is a disaster in my life | Update: i'm still alive. unfortunately | [deleted] | Now why do you wanna go and do that love? Smh. As someone who has been in your shoes I‚Äôm telling you that you should reconsider because there‚Äôs still fight left in you. Take a deep breath and cry. Sometimes we need a good ol‚Äô cry. We need to release all that pent up frustration. Then let that shit go. You made it this far just to give up. After everything you survived? You just gonna let the devil win? You never gave yourself back to God and tried to live your most authentic version. The version of you that lives in their true not caring about what people say or think. Because you know your heart. 

God knows your heart. And God sees. But I really think you should take time to really think. What do I like to do? What‚Äôs my passion? What could I see myself doing? Learn to love yourself again, and heal. When you start remembering who you are, watch how life changes. | [deleted] | I think i need people to talk with. I'm not going through a good moment. I need people to talk with and distract my mind on not doing that. | i just decided to give life a chance. I don't know why i didnt shot myself that night. | [deleted] | Brother please don‚Äôt do it I‚Äôm begging you | Watching porn is dangerous, you shouldn't lust over random strangers, naked or not naked. Instead of lusting over naked people, watch it for the scenario, then try to replace it with literature erotica instead. It's much healthier and still is indulgent | Who cares if you are a male ? Literally cry if you want
Complain if you want to
Talk about your struggles if tou want to 
Paint your nails if you want
Simply refuse to be a stereotype | they have it easy | They have it so easy and everyone rushes to their aid when something happens to them | You don‚Äôt understand though, i can‚Äôt do those things because for one i‚Äôm not gay( not in a mean way) and two society is gonna make your life a fucking living hell | It is still true when i show weakness i need to ‚Äúman up‚Äù and not be a pussy | Yes you can
Even if you aren't gay 
That is just male toxicity expecting you to not do those things | Hey man this has been very helpful and  informative, i‚Äôm sorry you feel that way i actually got taught how to read and write in english at a very very young age and always paid attention in school during english but i am acctually 14 i turned 14 9 days ago on the 31st so i guess i can understand you are suspicious but it‚Äôs true that i‚Äôm 14 | No i can‚Äôt my parents people around me will make fun of me and where i live it‚Äôs like a joke to do that | You think i don‚Äôt | You are only 14 told

One day you won't live with your parents anymore
What is the working legal age where you are ?
Focus on what you can do
Maybe in the future is better to be away from such toxic place and family | Most people on here are young cuz the ones who would be older stopped aging mate or they found a way to cope | I‚Äôm 16 too | It‚Äôs no secret that depression has hit Gen Z harder than any other generation present, and past. Internet, phones, social media, the pervasive spread of politics as your identity and the divide and suffering it causes, societal expectations, and so on.   
Getting off social media, offline frequently, reading a book, leaving my phone behind, taking time to just stop and think what am I doing, what should I be doing right now. Taking time out of the day for self care.   
All that reduces FOMO, the dopamine ransacking we‚Äôre assaulted with daily with the need to constantly be entertained and be in the know with an avalanche of information and 24/7 news streams about anything and everything happening here, there, and everywhere.   
Unplug, see how it feels. | Don't hate yourself. Just realize that it is a feeling that comes and goes. I've been thinking about suicide since I was a kid (stressful, alcoholic home), and here I am decades later. For many of those decades I barely thought about it, because I was relatively happy (wife, child).  


Since divorce and estrangement, not so much, but I still have good days and bad days. It's always stress and the feeling of being overwhelmed by life that triggers it for me... the feeling that I cannot cope, that life will always be awful.  


I am sorry that so many young people feel that way. If I could make it go away... but life is often stressful. What I've found helps more is if I can stay curious. ""Why is this happening? What can I do to ameliorate it?""  


Please hang on, I can almost guarantee those around you care. There was no burden I wouldn't have borne for my kiddo. :-( | How are you now? | One thing Gen Z is doing that others have not been doing near as much is bringing awareness to mental health and really making it a priority. Good on them. | Damn.....but why does the world hate you? | Don‚Äôt leave because the masses are dumb. People who have perspectives like yours are my favorite people. Outsiders are awesome. We need people like you to teach the masses to wake up. That‚Äôs one of the reasons why I hung on and found my purpose.  
Don‚Äôt let the world steal your joy. | I envy your childhood so much | Surviving | [deleted] | [deleted] | Me too | For me it's kind of the opposite. Like I'm just self sabotaging my life until it's my only option left as a way out. That's what brings me comfort | Not to shit all over the point you're making, but I often regret the fact I'm still here, rather than embrace it. Things didn't get better | [deleted] | [deleted] | It is misery but living is worse | [deleted] | [deleted] | problem is that i relate to being lonely to a depressing amount too much | [deleted] | Take a nap lol | [deleted] | It only got worse for me | That‚Äôs how I got fucking depressed in the first place. Got a shitty game community that bullied me until I got depressed.¬† | My death would give my parents peace. They worry constantly about how I'll never be able to support myself and that I have no friends (they are right but still). I don't want them to worry anymore but I don't want to better my life as well. I just want to disappear forever. I wish I never fucking existed. | [deleted] | Same. | If 99%of the world finds you ugly, there is still about 75-80,000,000 people who find you beautiful | You‚Äôd be surprised at how many people are unhappy with their looks. Even beautiful people. It‚Äôs kind of crazy honestly. 

And no one cares about an ugly face more than the person wearing it. So that is something else to consider. Like if you are ugly, which might not even be true, you‚Äôre the only one thinking about it constantly. You‚Äôre the only one who *truly* cares about it. So lighten up, love yourself. And there is something particularly attractive about a confident person even if they aren‚Äôt conventionally pretty.  Plus, you‚Äôre young. And as you age you will change considerably. Many people blossom later in life. | Me too , I don‚Äôt know how to help you because I really can‚Äôt even support myself but I just wanted to let you know you‚Äôre not alone | This.   


Also, while most of us would prefer to be loved and have partners, it is perfectly possible to live a life without that and have it not suck. I think Keanu Reeves made that point in something I saw. | Thanks | Bro 3 inches is big enough to have sex with. When a girl catches feels for you to her your penis will seem like 5-6 inches because she in love with you. As long as you can maintain an erection and not cum till she does. Get your oral sex on point and use fingers when you cum. However i dont think a 3 inch penis is your problem, i think you have hard time getting girls or cant stand rejection so you use your size as your problem/ excuse to never feel rejection or whatever your reason is to stay in your current place. Trust me 3 inches is enough for a girl. | i‚Äôm so confused bc as a woman, i prefer smaller cocks and most of my friends do as well. I‚Äôm extremely petite so smaller has always felt perfect. If someone truly loves you, your penis size will be the least of their concerns. | [deleted] | [deleted] | wait till u find out women don‚Äôt care about size üò≠ even we are surprised and it‚Äôs the best of our lives. We tell all our friends about how good it was too üòÇ it‚Äôs not pathetic but it‚Äôs such a fun surprise | I mean it's a possibility that I never looked into. And no I don't have a weight problem, i'm about 160 at 5'8 which is pretty average. maybe if I lost 20 more pounds it may help the thigh gap, but my insecurities will still be there. | [deleted] | [deleted] | Yeah haha attention post :^) | [deleted] | This | Nah. some women do truly like micro penises especially those of us with vaginismus. Just because you don‚Äôt like them, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not true for some of us. Crazy assumptions tho.

Also, do you know what gaslighting is? I was giving a personal opinion, that‚Äôs not gaslighting that‚Äôs called sharing personal perspective ‚ò∫Ô∏è | Tell me why not. | I think the son was the ‚Äúcunt‚Äù in this situation for making such a drama | It will be worse as you age, the feeling of being defective leftovers is overwhelming. | [deleted] | I was able to figure out some problems and now I am for the most part good. Do you think maybe you can also sort the problems and continue? It is a very good point, why prolong seemingly endless misery if that is what you feel your future will be like so pretty much asking if you're sure that there isn't another way. | Wait for gta6 | Yeah. It's worse now that I'm 30. It was awful when I was 20. Never gets better. | Do you have proof that it will happen for me? Or am I just supposed to ""just wait a little longer"" for a woman who probably doesn't exist? | My standards are quite low as it is. All I ask is that a girl shares my religion and is somewhat attractive to me. I'm not out here hoping for a perfect super model. | If I could kill my desire for love, sex and a family I would. | That's like buying a bunch lottery tickets thinking you'll become a billionaire | 30 | Living in delusional copium is pointless imho, reality will eventually trample your expectations.
The last call to learn basic life features like sex and attain friendships is usually in the twenties, with time running against you. I d say its like trying to get out of quicksand. | [deleted] | To what? | [deleted] | Well, I won't be able to marry her, so what's the point? | [deleted] | Oh believe me, I will. You wouldn't understand though. Most secular white people don't. | [deleted] | yeah same, wanted to do it on a shooting range but I don't want to traumatize anyone |  this guy gets it! lol | Yes, have alot going on in life (dont we all haha) i'll be fine. :) | Don't do it I hope u are still here suicide is never a solution never will be listen I know it's hard but trust me there are others who feel the same u don't have to feel alone u will overcome all of the hardships I believe in u, u are incredibly strong and beautiful inside and outside keep going keep living it will all be okay¬† | Please, please respond. I really need to know you are okay. I know how hard it is to reach out, so if you can't do so offline, don't hesitate to keep posting. You deserve so much better. | It‚Äôs not you‚Äôre fine stay safe | And numerous mentally ill and developmentally challenged people weren‚Äôt diagnosed until recently | But many people also still think being gay is a mental illness or ""possession"" or whatever else | Definitely do feel like there's a social contagion; a lot more people have access to the info and explore themselves now but never end up transitioning. But we definitely existed in the 90s, and 80s, and 70s, etc. 

HRT for trans people has existed since the 1930s at least. We were one of the prime targets for Nazis. And we've found history of our existence in ancient burial sites and old texts | Whenever I imagine breaking down in front of my parents AGAIN, it doesnt look so good. I can already see their disappointed looks once they learn about my lies. I'm so sorry I really couldnt recover. It's not so easy getting back up when I've been so mentally unstable and death is the only option I consider. | I feel so bad for my cats I'm such an irresponsible owner for leaving them behind like this. And I really dont want to. I coulf use spending more time with them I love them so much they made surviving so much bearable I cant believe I'm leaving behind these precious babies I'm sorry for being a bad owner I'm sorry for not giving you better lives | It's my fault I am in this situation anyway. I just hate it. I don't want this at all. I wish I could bring back 2011, or 2015 or even just 2020 and I'll change everything. But I know that's not an option and since it's not, death is the only way to escape this. | ONE FUCKING HOUR and im so scared... Im so scared of the pain and what's about to come. Why did they made it so much harder to die. I wish I can just sleep it all off and never wake up. I'm so scared. What's gonna happen after I drown myself in that river. How long will it take for me lose consciousness. How painful is it actually. What if its not bearable and I end up with another unsuccessful attempt. What's gonna happen if I stop being a coward and face it. I wish they find my corpse immediately in the morning. I feel so bad my parents have to deal with this. And what's gonna happen once I die. I honestly hope such thing as second life exist. Despite how much I hate myself I know there's still a part of me that wants to try living... Just not this body ig... Or am I just gonna be gone gone?? That sounds scary too but it should be peaceful right. | im just really gonna dump everything here hoping i can atleast vent out some feelings. i hope i succeed pls pls just this once. i want to stop being scared. i want to stop overthinking. i want to leave already. i want to disappear so bad | maybe im just gonna spend the remaining half hour staring at the wall and let my mind just wander around. think about anything. where did it all go wrong? or berate myself for being pathetic and all. idk what to do at all. well there's so much to do but less time to make it all happen. maybe ill just hug my cat although she really doesn't like it. maybe she'll give in this time. for the last time. | i really hate looking at my left arm. its so ugly and full of scars. i also relapsed so there are new ones. i hate myself for doing this. years on enduring long sleeves. i cant wear sleeveless or short sleeves and guess what my parents never had a clue about it until my failed attempt last year after i showed them too. nothing really happened. i wish they let me visit a psychiatrist or something honestly. did they actually thought i was running away that day. no i was gonna drown myself but my coward ass couldnt do it not even after drinking a bottle of soju. did it not cross their mind that im mentally ill. but i know we cant really afford it either. medical care is way too expensive i didn't want to burden them with it. i also thought i could bounce back by then but it has become too easy to consider suicide as the only option. pandemic really did a number on me tho. i just stopped being confident. my anxiety worsen and overthinking has consumed me. i just stopped being the person i used to be. im sorry | first attempt and im tired i just want to sleep forever :) cat decided she's gonna make some fucking noises that i can hear her even when i was finally out of the house so close to walking i¬† the river. im putting her in the terrace bc i want to die so bad. i made some loud noises just now and im so scared my parents will figure out what im trying to do. a window of their room is literally facing the river im about to drown myself this is the worst ever i just want to disappear :)) | Hey, stranger, I know it's very very little in the face of what you're probably going through, but I really care (enough that I'm tearing up reading this at least) and I want you to live. 

You've probably heard all the stock standard good advice, but reach out to someone, call a helpline, do anything but ending it. Take a risk that might help fix things, if your life is at rock bottom, then maybe something random might end up bringing it up just a little bit. | I hope you are still here. | How does one spend their remaining one hour meaningfully?? So i can atleast lessen my regrets and be more courageous in this hopefully final attempt? How does Scared of the World by Sarcastic Sounds describe what I feel so perfectly. I'm so scared of this world. I dont want to be here anymore. | Friend I can only try to assure you life is not always what it seems to be from the outside looking in.. we always think what we don't have is what will make us happy but I can assure you reality is never enough. | unfortunately i am bc my cat decided to make some loud meows while i was tiptoing my way out of the house hoping to not wake my parents up. will attempt again in 20 minutes im locking her up in the terrace this time so she wont cry anymore :) | i just want to end it all why is everything so hard i cant really tolerate life anymore but this stupid survival instinct and the fear of unknown pain i hate it so much i hate it here i hate myself pls kill me pls make me disappear | no i have no appetite at all. i didnt eat dinner either. | Right?

Always found this guy's story intriguing and inspiring(?): [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man\_of\_the\_Hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_the_Hole) | yes, people are really awful now. it makes me feel this way as well. | I always hear ""treat yourself as you want to be treated"". But does anyone ever feel so worthless that they want to be treated horribly. I think it makes it easier to suppress the guilt regarding these thoughts of if I have no attachments | Agreeing with u/PriorOk3301

I'm happy for you that your life is better. But not every story is a happy ending. I'm 20 and had multiple experiences that shouldn't happen for my age and past teen life. And never wish on my worst enemy.

OP of you're still here. I hope you will stay strong. Sending positive vibes to you.

Edit: Correction | I'm late to the party but are you in a safe place in life? You might not want to divulge tour feelings here and I get that. | Your mission here is not done.  Your mission is to save a life by your smile. | I have many deformities from a birth defect. Since they are impossible or almost impossible to correct I don't see any point living with them. As well as the fact that my family hates me | [deleted] | Lol. What country you in? | 8 hours until midnight | Uh ok, which one? | Hope you pass on painlessly üôè | Takes it away from me though¬† | What do you mean by a safe place? | No thanks | I hope the same for you | I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that. | good luck, I hope we die by today | Like, do you have a place where you feel safe and ok? | Thanks for your advice üëç | They definitely do... They behave like they do and they say things that show that they do. | I have a very serious birth defect that interferes with my life, I can't be successful with it. They hate me because I'm not a nice person | Aw man :( I'm UK | I'll see if I can find it | Nope, it's a physical issue, but I do have autism as well. Thanks for your suggestion¬† | You don't need a rope. You need love and understanding. Death is an easy way out, one that cannot be undone. God says we can't kill and that means oneself. If you want to unravel the things that bother you, look to give your love to others less fortunate then you will be of something of great value, there is no other greater power than love. | If you ever need someone to reach out to I will listen, almost ended it 5 days ago. I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm here but I still deal with the pain | [deleted] | suicide is quite literally the most tough choice anyone can even attempt to think about, most people don‚Äôt realize how much will u need to make, it‚Äôs the only permanent choice in this world, u can‚Äôt change or redeem it through any means.

I remember reading a quote somewhere that suicide is the highest freedom anyone can achieve, since you choose how to die. | I‚Äôm not a coward let me tell ya. I been there and done that and I don‚Äôt mean a regular joe life neither. I was the bad guy a long time ago so that word ‚Äúcoward‚Äù is almost in the same room as ‚Äúrat‚Äù I think we all have a breaking point in life and if we don‚Äôt have the tools or if you really loose all you love why live it‚Äôs honorable not to suffer and make others suffer around you for being so happy if you know what I mean. That‚Äôs my point of view I‚Äôm debating to all it a wrap myself. Good luck with them choices of words. | [deleted] | Also i've been having a lot of existential crisis lately. I'm about to go fucking crazy. None of it makes any sense. I didnt choose to be born. I didnt choose my circumstances, my environment. And we all will die one day. Why does life have to be so hard? Why bad people have great lives while good people are being punished and taken advantage. I swear none of it makes any sense. I feel dissociated all the time. | I'm Autistic too. You want a hug man? | Genuine question. Why do you copy random comments? | gonna use this to remind myself that I can also be strong | YEAHHHHH THATS ITTT | What do you mean? | sorry for the confusion, I didn‚Äôt write this, I misunderstood you that‚Äôs why I asked. But I feel you, I think you should reflect on everything that has happened and ask yourself if you deserved it. If you keep getting negative thoughts, then do this: create a character in your mind, give it your story, then think if it deserved it? Keep in mind, this isn‚Äôt you, it‚Äôs someone else. You should get the answer that it didn‚Äôt deserve this pain. This world and people are horrible, just like the character, you didn‚Äôt deserve how they treated you, you went through so much, being harsh to yourself is gonna bring you even more down and give them what they wanted. Love yourself  enough to show them that you can heal. Your inner child deserves kindness. Forgive yourself, respect yourself, accept yourself, you deserve love and happiness. Search up vids on yt and try to follow what it suggests for few months, it would be hard, it‚Äôs a journey but you should continue to work on it no matter what you think of yourself, once you reach that level of good self esteem, it will be worth it. | I have similar thoughts. This might be hell actually | It could be but I don't think it's a glitch. It seems very intentional and like a lot of thought was put into how to punish and tourture people | Thank you <3 | Yeah i know its just really annoying, im waiting here now for a psychiatrist and I already know whats gonna happen, nothing helpful. | My health is extremely fucked, ppl always assume it‚Äôs easier for young ppl | Yep. Exactly. | Psychiatrist is probably the best bet though. You get a good medication and things will go good just gotta hope they get it right quick because being a lab rat while they test stuff isn‚Äôt fun but once they get it right life is different | I mean if you have schizophrenia your life is gonna improve if you take medication same for bipolar or regular depression etc. It depends on a person to person basis | >Nothing worse than feeling like you have no control in your own life, and/or that you've made one too many mistakes that led you here.¬†

Oh man, I can feel that too. | More or less same here, but i managed to go for a little walk in the cold, silent night. It is relieveing. No people, just me, my music, my memories | Christmas are only for children and for old people Who force their families to reunite | life is also real but mine is worse than death at this moment. | You understood nothing | Everyone keeps telling me to keep going with zero advice for the circumstances and I feel as if I am going to harm myself or others just to feel real. This life feels fake, everything is about money. I am to dumb to emigrate. | Wish I had valid advice for you. Relying on anything external to cope with this reality is a recipe for disaster. Some manage to create a heaven internally, but many aren't so fortunuate to be able to do that.

There comes to a point where health issues pile up high and you're too self aware for your own good.

  
For me personally, I'm at a crossroad, accept this reality or die. Can't continuing living if I don't accept, breaking hard mentally. | It‚Äôs more so the need for actual life accommodations. I don‚Äôt think the support groups can help with that unless I am diagnosed. I can barely function in day to day life and haven‚Äôt ever been able to but it‚Äôs always been brushed off, and I‚Äôve been faking being ‚Äúfine‚Äù for so long I don‚Äôt know if I ever was. I need someone else in my life to help me not just motivational stuff. Support groups are good but I find it‚Äôs just more; you‚Äôre life is sad? Do this or talk about this. 

I just want to not be sad, I don‚Äôt want to have to constantly ‚Äúcope.‚Äù I really think suicide is my best option. | It‚Äôs more so I feel like I am so fed up I will explode. Less about physically and more just saying stuff that I keep in to be socially acceptable. | Your parents will find out the body, and the news of your suicide will make them depressed for their life. | Is there something you would like to achieve in the next 10 years? | do u want to play animal crossing bro | Call out to God he‚Äôll take care of you | Yeah but i don't want they to be the first that saw :/ | Doesn't matter. They would have to live with the regret that they didn't communicate well with their child and that is the reason their child killed himself. They'll end up living a depressed life. What is it that makes you suicidal? | [deleted] | thank you for taking time to reply to my post i really really needed to hear this right now, i hope life works out for you and things get better | thank so much for taking time out of ur day for me:( ur the sweetest n i really appreciate it | ABSOLUTELY look into Buddhism. If you believe life is suffering, the Buddhists found a philosophy for that ages ago. I'm not saying you have to believe in everything, but it helped me a bit. | [deleted] | I want to know what I did to deserve this and not have the childhood others did | [deleted] | Because everytime I try I get hurt more and more | This resonates so much with me. I really thought these dark days were behind me a few months ago, and for the first time in my life and had genuine optimism for my future. How wrong I was | The fact my life has been shaped by certain people makes me so bitter and resentful, and I'm ashamed in admitting it. Like people have no idea how lucky they are | [deleted] | It's not healthy for me to obsess over it though but that's all I do lately l. I'm constantly reminded by it or triggered by so many things | Nothing about it is your fault, you likely extended her life while you were together. Guilt is a natural reaction, like anger or sadness, etc. She had probably been thinking about it since before you met | [deleted] | As someone who nearly put my ex this position I hope to comfort you. One I‚Äôm glad you understand why she was how she was, that empathy must make her real
Happy! Secondly she never did what she did to make you feel bad, you‚Äôre not to blame. | Thank you | I hope you recover | Was I as a boyfriend not responsible for her betterment? | Thank you so much. I'll try to do that. Your words have made an impact on my thoughts | Thank u. I think I just need reassurance that it's not my fault | I get that I do. And I'm sure in time I'll understand I did what I could in the time. But rn it's hard. Cause I'm sure if I just kept with it she'd be ok. And it makes me overthink everything I could've done better | Thank you. Ik in a few weeks I'll accept this and look back on this post and realize it's not my fault. But because it's so recent I feel accountable cause I was her last attempt at love and reassurance | A person I wanted my life with took theirs. It's not about being sad that that life can't be anymore. It's sad because someone I cared for a lot is now no longer able to keep going because of their struggles and it makes me wish I was more influential to save them. | Thank you | Thank you. It helps to think that just because I was the last part of her life doesn't mean I was a big part of her life. That thought really helps me | Thank you. I think it's just the fact she posted about wanting to die during our little fights about me being asleep and not responding to her and her thinking I don't love her that makes me think I could've reassured her better when I was awake and attentive that she's worth it. I try to take care of myself. I think the biggest red flag of us dating was we both got together because we both got cheated on and were sensitive about partners. At one point she even let a guy take her out irl during one of our breaks and posted it to make me jealous. Yes I was also sexting other girls so it was balanced between the two. She would fixate on the girls I sexted about how she wasn't enough despite her starving (she was kinda ed) and then accuse me of not liking her despite me saying that I liked her more than anyone else and only did it for validation. So I feel responsible for not fighting or idk. She always compared herself to the other girls I been with and never felt reassured that she was better. And that's what makes me feel like it's my fault | This is the insight I was really hoping for from the other side. It really let's my mind see the picture from her perspective and I wanna say rationalize but idk that word feels wrong given the circumstances. I hope you don't end up doing it. Not just for her. But yourself as well. It gets better. I got cheated on before and it takes a long time to let go of someone you love. But it gets better and the rest of your life is worth living after u get past it. | Ya that's true. But we both seaked someone to fix us. And I'm still alive so I can only imagine she helped me. But she's dead and it makes me feel like I couldn't fix her and that's my fault. | I did try better help for a few months. Therapy is just too expensive for an avg Joe. The cost of living is too high to spend $300 a month on ($3600 a year) for 4 sessions a month (48 sessions a year) | Maybe you're right. Maybe I should resubsribe. It just felt unassuring with her telling me all my problems. I'll look into it. It's just a tight budget | I've never tried those. I'm not suicidal rn. Just sad about how things ended up with her. It makes me feel like I wasn't able to save her from killing herself | Ey hit that boy back up, things are gunna be ok, just gotta let this storm pass ‚ù§Ô∏è | I believe I understand this suicidal perspective. ""It will eventually end up bad so why bother? Why also potentially left him hurt in future?"" This was my thoughts that blocked me from asking out to a girl who were just left by her boyfriend. I really felt she was just like whom I am looking for. I hesitated and she killed herself. I had my chance to go to her door and push her to go out of the house she trapped herself to dark thoughts. I hate her for killing a nice person, which is so hard to find nowadays. So give some room to him will you? Be open, tell your intention to him. Can it still end up like you foresee in case you guys become together? Maybe. But you, good people, don't give things enough chances. | Same I go on dates every week with some random girls but I am just sick in the end because none of them are like the love of my life that I lost in 2021 and I just want to kill myself in the end | sorry but i'm dead set on doing it, it hurts because i feel like things in the future could be good but i'd have to put in so much effort and i'm so far behind with no sense of work ethic or motivation in the slightest and i have so many factors against me like being mute, autism, my dad taking me out school, not being able to find a job for those reasons, etc... this is just how i am destined to be and i can't delay it any longer. i already put it off in hopes things would get better, but they only got worse. i can't keep living in my delusions. | it's not a storm, it's my entire life. i don't remember when i wasn't depressed | i let it slip because i was so upset that i had to hide it, but i regret telling him. it hurt not being able to tell him, but it hurt more to have him know. im so weak. | it's too late, i already told him its because i am going to kill myself. i hate myself for opening up about it | i shouldnt annoy people with my feelings like that its better to keep it to myself so i dont hurt anyone | thanks, i feel you are the only one who is understanding :/ he cut me off anyways so.. | i agree | i'm not here for your pity, i just came to vent | There are 2 sides to if for sure, a time before the storm came. 

That absolutely might be a long time ago, but that doesn't mean it was always there. 

This depression and you are separate, you are going through this, but this isn't you. 

You aren't faulted, you aren't broken. You're in a lot of pain, and sometimes the brain wraps the truth in those times. 

Lil steps, thats all we can physically do, one at a time. | i don't have the energy anymore. i see no reason to keep going | nah, i'm fated to kill myself, i deserve it | No you don't you fucking Muppet, stop doing this. Stop beating ya self up. 

You're a lil fucked up, but that's A-OK ‚ù§Ô∏è | even so, i cant really do anything tbh. i don't genuinely want to kill myself, but i know it is just the best and easiest option. i'm not going to keep living just on the hope that something is going to come save me because i know i sure as hell cant save myself. i thought about some awesome guy coming into my life and getting me out of my house, but i know that's a stupid pipe dream and way more than i should ever expect especially since i have so much baggage. i let it slip that its what i was hoping for to this guy and it clearly made him uncomfortable. i have distanced myself ever since and it was kind of the final straw for me. even if hypothetically i got with him and saw if it would work out, he knows how pathetic i am and would be too scared to be himself or leave me because he knows i'm a landmine that could be set off at any moment. it's just not worth it to put someone through any of that, but it'd be my only hope. i'm not doing that to someone. | it doesn't take much to make reddit posts and comments, stuff like this is pretty much all i do every day because i cant do anything else. cant have a job, cant do school, cant find love, cant have hobbies, cant make friends, etc. i dont even care if i have some deep down well of energy inside me either because i dont see a future that wont hurt me for years to come even if there is even a chance of a light at the end of the tunnel. why would i keep trying when it's never worked and not guaranteed to? | i'm happy for you but not everyone is you | i really can't do much. i try to eat healthier and go on walks more but that can only do so much for your mental state. i can't change the fact that i am in this house and my chances were ruined at ever having a good job. nobody is going to save me because of how much of an emotional mess i am with so much baggage and i sure as hell can't save myself | i'm not denying that the future could be good but i'm not strong enough to  keep waiting for that future or to do anything to get to it, suicide is just way easier and more appealing since i won't have to ever worry about anything again. long ago i used to be so scared of death but sometimes i kind of pray that someone will come rob me and kill me, but that hasnt happened so i have to take it into my own hands - thankfully that means it will be painless then. why suffer more? your last moments should be happy, and they will be | i am mute and my dad took me out of school years ago. i live in an american suburb with no form of transportation. i will not be able to afford to move out of here for years. i would rather die. | he's not my boyfriend, we've only been talking for like two weeks and just play a game together. my family doesn't care about me, my sister got called after i attempted suicide and my friend at the time didnt know i was alive so she was asking my sister to check on me. guess what happened? she went right to her room and started talking to her friend like nothing happened. she was apparently also sounding annoyed on the phone when my friend called her. i dont care about how internet strangers feel abt me, they will forget me. you will forget me in a couple days, maybe less.

my method will kill me. i have a painless method that i have researched and just need to get the materials for it. surviving and being in pain is not an issue, the worst that could happen is a bad headache.

and i just found out that he blocked me so yknow, i ruined my only way out of this life lol just like i ruin everything. wonderful | I've tried it and it doesn't help at all. I was in the hospital for a week and still am pretty much alive. Don't try it please. | I didn‚Äôt pass out my mum found me pretty much | You tried antifreeze? | I can have a phone but not a charger so I snuck one into my room lolol | The knife had a chipped edge I got pretty close to the carotid it was in there deep I struggled to get through the thick muscle on the neck with a chipped knife if ethylene glycol doesn‚Äôt work I will use a sharper knife | Why do you say this have you seen it before ? | Yes I tried it | Did you go to hospital or did somebody find you ? | I feel like all suicide methods come with that if it doesn‚Äôt work it‚Äôll make you wish it did you really gotta pick your poison man its tough out here | Yes I woke up in the hospital after throwing up for about one day and half night continuously | And my sis found me
There's nothing that thing can do really 
You'll just end up suffering more | Yeesh, that‚Äôs pretty rough but it won‚Äôt stop me Ik something that causes that is if the ethylene glycol isn‚Äôt strong enough Ik I wanna die and I find it pretty Ik that sounds extremely psychopathic but just knowing that I will never experience anything ever again seems beautiful to me | I‚Äôm trying to get at least a litre of it down I‚Äôve done research and I haven‚Äôt seen anything about chemical burns that‚Äôs only bleach and drain cleaner | Your not a whore.

Edit: sorry first comment here, but sending nudes is a common thing and guys like that suck. I'm sorry this happened to you. | I (17M) made this exact same mistake with several people _within the same month_ when I was 13, so I can deeply relate to everything you said here. I felt so disgusted and resentful towards myself, and I cried and thought about killing myself pretty much every day. It was the most painful thing that I'd ever experienced. But even so, I'm still here, and honestly, I can't remember the last time that it even slightly bothered me. In fact, even 1 year after it happened I had more or less moved on from it all.

My point is, time really does heal you, and you _will_ feel better about it some day. I know it may seem like you're gonna be trapped in this maze of guilt your whole life, because I've been there too. But since I've been there myself, I can promise you that it'll all get easier with time. 

(TL;DR) Please stay with us; I was in your exact position years ago, and it's not worth ending your life at 15 for one mistake that'll one day seem so insignificant to you. | how about dont be sending stuff when your underaged anyways? nobodys fault but yours. | Wait. Were you both dating or what? If he pretended that he was with you and then after the events just dumped you then he's just an asshole. It doesn't make you a whore at all. Wtf. Even if it was some random guy who you liked a lot - it doesn't make you a whore. I don't fucking get this type of thinking. Why is it always girls who are being labeled like this? He showed you his pee pee, why isn't he a whore?Just be aware that this type of dickheads can send your nudes to someone. But don't let them get you scared, or you might get into a neverending circle of same shit.Aside from that, If he's not doing something like that with your nudes, then i don't get why you are so upset. I'd recommend you to consider it like a one night stand. You liked the guy, so it's not really bad i guess. But yeah, a lot of guys tend to use this manipulative lying about feelings tactics on girls who are not willing to just have sex/exchange nudes and it makes THEM a bad person, not you. | Eh, who cares. You'll never see them again. | If you were a waste, nobody would bother reply.

If you were unlovable, your words wouldn‚Äôt reach my heart.

If you were all those things you think yourself to be, there would be plenty of room to grow.

I fear hurting you with my words, because I care to be a friend.

I fear you not seeing for yourself that people make mistakes.

I fear you listening to thoughts that only put you in pain.

I‚Äôm sorry fellow human that you‚Äôve had to feel this, I empathize with your feeling of pain so I know you hurt.

From life I know this too shall pass, but it‚Äôs going to hurt for a while. | I fully agree with this person. 

Also, you‚Äôre not a whore, but he‚Äôs a fucking idiot that doesn‚Äôt deserve you. | Yep. This is child pornography and they can both get arrested for it. Stop sending nudes OP. | youre gonna be sick as all hell and suffer excruciating please go to emergency care!!! | Holy fuck. OP are you in the hospital right now? | get someone to take u to the ER asap | [deleted] | Same. It's been a couple of years but I haven't seemed to have lasting effects. In the moment there was a few hours I couldnt move and I was nauseous for a few days after but that passed and I've felt okay since. The comments have me nervous now though üòÖ | I just waited. Nothing came of it but everybody's body composition and tolerance is different too | You‚Äôre not alone | Deleted account. Later I guess‚úåüèº | [deleted] | Try quitting social media instead of quitting life | Its not just about this person. I also don't want to be a burden to my family anymore. | Thank you for your concern but I will go.  If not today then tomorrow | No way to know :( | Friend I‚Äôm in the same situation we must be very strong. | Set a goal stick to it no matter what, Achieve goal, smile about it. 
Meet new people. 
Get new hobbies.
Set new goal stick to it. IT works over time | im also 17 and im in the same situation, i always say some dumb shit and the way i am drives people away from being real close to me | Me too girl. I‚Äôm 18 and it kills me that I‚Äôm like this. Hopefully we can get better‚ù§Ô∏è | I wish the world would end 

It‚Äôs almost chronically I‚Äôm embarrassed at this point | I‚Äôve spoken to them in the past about it and they‚Äôve tried to reassure me but I just can‚Äôt believe them | I feel like they feel bad for me | You are right. | üß° | Cut off most contacts with your parents, if you'll see them once every quarter they probably won't be that bad. My parents don't love me neither. In fact my mom genuinely hates me lmao | üß° | I understand your feelings. It happened to me, a lot. But now I realized: no, they don't care and probably never will. | Thank you. üß° | I feel you so much | [deleted] | Yeah, I've found therapy to have been pretty pointless.  It's all basically fake it until you make it...  but, what if you never make it? | [deleted] | I'm glad you feel something my friend. Its the relatable posts that hits us in the feels | I found myself pretending I was doing better to my therapist(s) so they wouldn't feel bad. Had them all fooled. | I have the same sentiment.

I'm sure it helps for some people who just need someone to listen to them. However, for me it didn't do anything - I just felt like I wasted my time and money. Everything my therapist suggested I had already tried before coming to them. | Then you end up on this sub. | And out people only exist online | This is why I'm done reaching out. I've exhausted all options bar heroin. Keep fighting üí™ | See my older posts | Thank you. You're so right. | üôÉ like that? | Thank you so much and I'm proud you've fought for so long | Yeah, failing therapy is a kinda strange feeling.  Some of them can make you feel like you let them down... makes you wonder who's supposed to be helping who.  Was I just in it to give them warm fuzzies as I show continuous improvement under their care? | Just hang in there, slugger. It'll get better üòÜ | I remember feeling that way when I was around your age. I had a similar experience to the one you described. It sounds like things are really overwhelming right now; I'm sorry you're struggling so much. Do any of your friends know what you're going through? | Rape is an incredibly hard moment to go through. I appreciate immensely that you have shared something so vulnerable with us. We are here to offer support if you need us. I see many individuals (including me) who are rooting for you! | Please, don't do it, if you didn't do that, this isn't worth it, you're not going to be like that, I beg you, sure it is trauma, but no, please | Rather be a drug addict than be dead, you can be happy and have no worrys ever. If your gonna do it anyways then atleast try heroin first ;) | Because the police don‚Äôt care enough around me it seems 

Or don‚Äôt have the recourses | Don't give up. I'm sure there are better opportunities out there. | [deleted] | totally get that, i don't think i'll make it to my 20s | how old are you? | [deleted] | I feel this a lot... I don't know when the suicidal thoughts actually started but I'm 16 now and my mom tells me that... A lot... When I tell her about how I feel and I always get ""you haven't even lived life yet"". I don't know what she really means, I've lived life since the second I started to breathe air... But I understand this completely... | how old are u now if u don‚Äôt mind me asking? | tysm. <3 i never thought i needed friends or a community but i think i do now. i just have no idea how to reach out to ppl cus i‚Äôm awkward and socially anxious. also no one wants to be friends with a depressed person who never has energy to do anything. but i‚Äôll try | oh ok thx i was just curious. i‚Äôm 20 btw | is there something in particular that‚Äôs bringing you down? like work/school? | damn that sucks. i hope you find other people though but yeah it‚Äôs not easy when suicidal and depressed | u too | I'm sorry that life hasn't been kind to you. I feel pretty shitty right now too but I'm crying reading your post. I don't even know what to say but I don't judge you, I understand it. | [deleted] | I hope you make it though this and come back to love, happiness, overwhelming luck. You deserve the best. | [deleted] | My peace with be dying most likely. Thanks tho mate. | Labetalol | I wish lol. I take virtual hugs thoü´Ç. Thank you | Yep. | Yep | I'm sorry your also struggling. Stay strong ml. You have a future of happiness.<3 | I good thank you:) | Update; I'm good | Naw I was fine. I have mild symptoms now. Plus I don't have the money to go to a psych ward. | Yup, I'm good mate. | Please don't. It's not worth it. I'm literally having trouble breathing rn. You have hope, love. | I good. I got really tired and passed out super quick. | Thank you, and I'm sorry you have those thoughts:( | Yeah I'm good | I'm ok no worries:) | Idk bout that. But thank you. | I'm dyslexic so I have no idea what that means. Like, how much did I take? Idk like over 100 mg | Two each were 100 mg | I'm good. Nty | Oh gawd, that sounds like an awful experience I'm hope your ok. | I'm ok now | <3 I'm good | Good, I just slept for a long time | Yup | No. And yeah, it does. | Please don't love. | Yeah I'm good thx | It's a heart medication for high heart rates. It slows down the heart. Potentially stopping it if you take too much. I don't think it will work I didn't take alot | I'm good y'all<3 | Yes I definitely agree there is a reason for that. be patient. I have these active intentions but anything can change over night I seen that in my life. | Idk maybe. | Thank you will do:) | Yeah I live in us | No I'll sleep it off DW. | I am | Idk. Like 300 mg. I think I took right below that tho. | Ok. I just said what it's used was for. Thank you. | Yup. Thanks mate. | Just stay safe yourself mate. | It was but I'm ok now. (VERY off topic but Jake and Johnnie is amazing I love my emo bsfs) | Trust me you aren't missing out, sex is overrated. | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | Cool. Doesnt change a thing | No. I‚Äôm the problem. I‚Äôm useless and bring absolutely nothing to the table. I was a stillborn, just took me years to figure it out. | Tried that. Doesnt help | Cool. Not going to change anything | Right let me support an industry that actively supports sex trafficking, takes advantage of vulnerable women, and doesn‚Äôt actually provide the companionship that I clearly need. It‚Äôs not hard to read between the lines and realize its not just about sex. | I genuinely don‚Äôt get why? Why do people feel it absolutely fucking necessary for others to live? I‚Äôm living an absolutely miserable life with no hope of it getting better, and yet I‚Äôm expected to keep living it? For what? | Think again. Dysfunctional family, and most members I would never want to see again. I literally told my buddy I was going to kill myself and he just said, ‚Äúdamn,‚Äù and continued to play his game. | This matters, why? | I get it. | I work, too stupid for school, and have nothing to do outside of work due to anhedonia | Only 3.9% of adults between 25-30 are virgins. People like me and OP? We are the losers of society. And to be honest, what's the harm in suicide? | Happy birthday! | Today is my birthday too lmao | Happy birthday! I‚Äôm so grateful you‚Äôre here today. Sometimes there‚Äôs just those deep dark times that seem never ending that you really just have to push through, willingly or not. The world is a better place with you in it. I pray the world is kind to you this year. | Your mom is a horrible person. Do not let her win by doing what she wants. You go make a good life for yourself. Cut her out of your life. You can get better family. | Fuxk..she deleted the account. I hope she's okay. This is fucked. I'm so sorry. | [deleted] | Quite the amazing support group here. There‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs a match to every feeling you have. | I hope you can find a safe place here too | I‚Äôm sorry about your wife. You‚Äôre a good person being there for her. I hope you can find someone who can be there for you too. | My wishes to you as well | And somehow are blissfully unaware | That‚Äôs more acceptable to society | If you were good before you were struggling then you‚Äôre probably just unwell. It‚Äôs not because you‚Äôre not a good person anymore just a hurt one now. | I believe you have some wisdom worth sharing, thanks for what you have shared. | I relate. I was planning to kill myself yesterday, but ultimately chickened out. The thoughts still linger in my mind and I do still have the rope I was going to use. I might try again tomorrow and see if it will be successful. Hopefully, without chickening out. I just need to get over my fear of death. I‚Äôve been happier ever since I started and planned my suicide. | I like this advice. When I was really close to the edge of my cliff, I felt like the only true peace and joy I got was when I decided that I was going to die soon.

So someone reminded me that I AM going to die soon, whether I do it myself or not. We all are. Soon enough. So why not just try to have a good time until we go?

We could just keep this mindset of releasing worry because we‚Äôll have so much peace when we‚Äôre dead, and use it to keep us going until we die at our own time. | [deleted] | I can‚Äôt anymore. I‚Äôm a disappointment, and I don‚Äôt want to continue being one. I have fallen so far in life that I have hit rock bottom. No matter what do to climb back up, I always hit rock bottom again. I had finally found a job I enjoyed and was happy to be at, but then I got laid off. Also, the owner basically said I wasn‚Äôt good enough for his salon and is now ignoring me. Finding another job has been difficult, I‚Äôve been applying everywhere, but to no avail. I‚Äôm done. I don‚Äôt want to continue dealing with this. I don‚Äôt want to live a sad and miserable life. I used to be a gifted girl growing up, but now, I am just a burnt out adult. So many people had high expectations for me, but I‚Äôve disappointed them. I just can‚Äôt go on like this. I don‚Äôt want to. | I‚Äôm alive. Thanks for the kind words friend. | I feel you, i still feel isolated every day. Even though i do agree reddit isn't the best site to be on, i think it's always good to have a safe place to say what's bothering you without judgement. It lifts a lot of burden you have kept inside for so long and at least lets you know that you are not alone. I hope this makes sense | I've been feeling the same but somehow seeing other people... Experience the same awful feelings I'm like... Hold on maybe this isn't the best choice. Idk. It does suck and it's isolating | I fought it from my teens until I was 24. Then I fell in love, gradually, with someone, and we married and were together for almost 30 years. Then she divorced me. Why? I dunno. As best I could figure out, she became someone else. I was crushed and fell back into depression.

But I eventually climbed out of it. Anyhow, you may well have good years ahead of you. And, if you work on your mental health, you might even keep them.

Life is kind of a rollercoaster. But there are things we can do to help keep our mood more stable. | altho i am much younger i do feel this as well. i have been going through a hard time here and i have been considering killing myself for the past weeks. reddit has been the only place i could even say anything. i dont wanna talk to friends about this so i just have been using this hell of a place to vent my feelings out and talk to people whoever is willing. its just so hard to deal with it | It's good to know I am not alone | Thank you | Yes it does. Thans for being understanding | I am solid to know I am not alone. It feels desperate but I have nothing else | I am glad to hear that I am not alone thank you | I hope you are able to pull through even though I understand how difficult it is | I am sorry for your experience. I know It's not easy but I hope you eventually pull through | thank you, i hope you can pull through it too. it is a hard journey but we all here relate to the experience and all are doing it together | Wow. This is pretty much exactly how I feel | I suppose you gotta die at some point anyway | [deleted] | Your kids need you. Please stay for them. The pain they will face will stay with them forever. | Stop wallowing in your self pity bro seriously. You're painting a picture of yourself as a scum when you are highly successful in life and have so many blessings. I'm not trying to guilt trip you but look you have a family and are a good parent whose kids deserve as a father. You're a kind soul and that counts for something. Hell, everybody makes mistakes, I bombed out of college twice, done thoughtless things to push the people I've loved away, and have been in a rut for the past 5 years. It's better than being dead though | [deleted] | I‚Äôm still here for now, my mind hasn‚Äôt changed though. | I can‚Äôt see any other solution. I‚Äôve lost everything and I‚Äôll never get it back. | I want to comfort u but I can't find the right words. This is very relatable to me. I'm a woman but I'm so ugly that all the boyfriends I hv had would see me naked once and never again. I'm like a turn off switch and it's so worthless because I'm not good at anything in life and this was the one way I could get someone to hold me close if we could have intimacy but nobody wants that with me 

I hope it gets better somehow for u 

You are not alone | Don‚Äôt give up because there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you. Love comes at the right time. Personality is the most important thing and noble deeds wins the day not good looks. Also you can‚Äôt buy yourself love | Short king. Your throne is awaiting you. Take it with pride | [deleted] | Thanks. Same to you. Hope it gets better. | 8 billion people on the planet. But I have access to‚Ä¶.. zero. No money to afford to fly around the globe. Standards are way to high in my country for me to ever even register on peoples radar‚Ä¶. It never even began | Why should I believe it? It‚Äôs not true. | [deleted] | Simply following orders is easy if you give up thinking at all. | I'm terrified of being reprimanded just for feeling like shit all the time... so i just lied my way through everything. I'm a grown up but i can't do anything right. I gave up long time ago and i just can't seem to let anything go all the same. Probably because I'm incapable of ending it all anyway. 

The simple answer is that I'm stuck. There's no choice. I have to survive whatever the cost. Living is a completely different topic though. Surviving, even badly, i can do. Anything else is beyond me idk. | Don't know ...think about my family and shit...already lost my dad at 11 | Counting the days before i commit suicide. Each day goes with the thought that one more day gone | I ask the same question lol | [deleted] | Worst advice...why do you want him to live in denial...it just takes the pain away but the problem still remains | Awh man, subintentional suicidality sucks... Hope you get a laugh somewhere today | A big enough truck and that body will feel like a pebble under those tires. Driver won‚Äôt even notice. This is my plan. Messy but definite. Give the cops something to clean up lol¬† | Idk but It really sucks not knowing | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | i hope its like this. i really do | [deleted] | [deleted] | Im under the assumption that my mind and consciousness will just cease to exist, but yeah, it is, anywhere but here, im bored of this place. And besides im gonna die anyway | I agree. There isn't much left to see here | We have souls? | [deleted] | Ik bro, the quality of life is decreasing, inflation will keep on rising. It wouldn't surprise me if we go back to living like how it was in medieval times, where you were either super rich or super poor | I should mention I am 22 years old, jobless, not on disability. I am completely fucked. | [deleted] | I wish I could reincarnate as a neurotypical as well | Wow, you spoke my thoughts out loud. I am still trying to figure it out. Trying not to go on a drinking binge because the only time I feel any sense of normalcy and temporary relief. I am sorry for your loss.. | You're still the victim. And unfortunately you're accepting the victim role. But that isn't your fault. It's never the victims fault for the trauma and how you end up coping. I just want you to know there are better ways and possibilities of recovering. This was a good step opening up. The people through this subreddit are some of the most supportive and knowledgeable people out there. I truly hope someone shows you some resources to look into that can set you right. Those dark moments don't define you or your future. Get better kid | I really don't think you are a bad person at all if that means anything.

You were raped , and are now having a very difficult time with life. That's why it's so fucked up to hurt people like that.

I sometimes struggle with thinking I'm a bad person still, but the thing that got me to start changing that perception was realizing that my core values would not judge someone else like me as a bad person. I was judging myself so much more harshly than I judged others.

Even though I heard people tell me this a thousand times, it never sank in until it did. I was in therapy for a couple years leading up to that point, so there was apparently other things I had to learn (or, unlearn) before I could have even just a bit of self love, even though I deserved it the whole time.

I hope you are safe right now. | Because I made it worse so I clearly deserved it or wanted it because other victims wouldn‚Äôt dream of doing this | Twitter | Have sex and sell nudes for money | Mostly online stuff now
I do want to stop tho | Idk whose going to read this comment, probably no one but tomorrow i have another few hours to leave the house, like 2-3 hours im gonna do it then, i wont scared this time i hope but i wont | Still here | It‚Äôs going to take years, i don‚Äôt want to live all those years and even after i leave it‚Äôll still be so complicated | Yes | Still here | My parents are just strict and paranoid, i live in a safe area but if i left the house alone and didnt even tell them they‚Äôd freak out and im 14 too so it makes sense i guess | I didnt, got too scared like an idiot | Im still here unfortunately i went home last night but got there in time before my parents ive just been thinking of what to do | I dont think its bravery i just got scared | Not really abusive but parents aren‚Äôt very fond of me anyways, plus im 14 it‚Äôs going to take years to get out my house and theyre very religious but i dont necessarily agree with the religion or wanna be apart of it now or when i grow up so idk | Im happy youre better now but im not strong enough to wait till im free and can leave, its going to take years. Fastest way is uni far away but who am i kidding im not smart enough to get a scholarship to a school and if i get in idk if my parents can pay for it. If they pay for it i certainly cant cut them off so i'll have to work and pay for it myself which depends on how much the scholarship is and what job i could even get while going to uni i dont even know if i can pass my gcses or a levels i cant do a 9th grade math test im not bullshitting myself making myself believe i can actually get good enough grades to get out of here so im taking the easy option and leaving | I didnt mean complicated like i wont have money i mean i wont but i can deal with that, theres other stuff that‚Äôll come up and wont ever go away and i dont want to deal with that | Where i live i dont even know if we have a crisis hotline for suicide even if we do they wont do shit if you‚Äôre a minor except send u back to your parents. | Im not strong enough to continue either i just got scared i dont wanna keep fighting i might be dead the next day or the day after, im just trying to calm the nerves | im sorry that happened to you but i dont think people here are grasping how religious my parents are, to them im a religious girl who follows all the rules and tries to be the best, if i kill myself now they'll remember me as that and still me and have the consolation that im in heaven. If i keep living and leave my religion or practice significantly less theyre going to think im going to hell and start to resent me...the first option just sounds better. 

I dont want them to know who i really am or how i feel but i dont want to hide me forever and live my whole life unhappy but i also dont want to show them how i really feel and have them hate me. I cant win either way so im leaving im tired of thinking about it, or talking about it. Im going to hell anyways, might as well get there earlier | no not this much, i talk to my school counsellor abt stuff shes nice but i havent told her about this cause shes legally obligated to tell my parents and then its gonna get worse | I don‚Äôt know how to draw that. Hold on

ü§óü´Ç | [deleted] | I know it doesn‚Äôt mean much, but please know you are not alone. I would give you a hug if I could. | [deleted] | haha, it actually does help a bit! | *virtual hug*
i hope you get a real one soon. i'm sorry for whatever you're going though ü´Ç | thank you
hugging you right back c: | Yeah i don‚Äôt understand too | Saw their page history just before they deleted. Seemed like they were suffering for a long time and had BPD. I hope they still here üôèüèæ | i hope you‚Äôre still out there. i really do | [deleted] | This is always about ""you need to do that or that"" but they don't care about u really. | I wouldn't even wanna do this on my worst enemy | Yeah life is meaningless but i think we‚Äôre supposed to make it meaningful. But if its too overwhelming then i hope you succeed in whatever decision you choose <3 | I'm sorry bro. You deserve a lot better than this affliction. | [deleted] | I woke up with extreme pain everywhere in my body and an uneasy feeling in my stomach, I ended up throwing up hard and I think I‚Äôm fine now | Go get your stomach pumped. 911. They can do it in the ambulance. | lol this | Thank you for commenting. I feel like this is the only place where ppl understand sometimes. Everyone in real life makes fun of me and judges me for being traumatized which makes it worse. I think the judgement from being traumatized was worse than the actual trauma. I feel like people use me to make themselves feel better. Even if I died people wouldn‚Äôt care and probably just make fun of me more. Maybe some people would use me for attention but I think people mostly wouldn‚Äôt care. People who mistreat me say they couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me but I wasn‚Äôt asking for their help and most of the time they were asking me for help. | 1. I don't think God gives a shit about anything that people think he does. I don't believe he gives a shit about transsexuals, homosexuals and any kind of kink. Cause why create people and give them this desire and then define it as sin. Wouldn't make sense.
2. You made a mistake by stealing it. Next time buy whatever you like. 
3. No one can and should judge you for whatever you are doing as long as it doesn't involve them and as long as it makes you happy. Accept yourself the way you are. | [deleted] | Maybe you like women so much that you are trying to imitate or make an idol of them ü§î | Yeah but I stole it.... And I'm from a Christian Family and My parents hate these types of People... And I don't want to be one I don't want to be like this. I want to be Better than this..... | Maybe... But I regret it and I don't want to be like that.... | Consider that not everyone here is A) a native and b) from the US. No it's not a kink. It's hard wired. But it's also on the list of things these super conservative people tell you he would condemn. | I‚Äôm so sorry I‚Äôm here if you ever need someone to talk to | I am so sorry love these comments are truly telling I hope you're surrounded by people who support you if not there's a big community in online spaces wishing you the best <3 | I am so sorry. I wish things were better for us. I wish you all the best¬† | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | I agree. Thank you ü•∫ | You and BlitzerCL are the only reason I haven‚Äôt strengthened my resolve at this point so thanks | üíúüíú | Do you need to learn how to speak Thai to live there? Cuz if not, then it‚Äôs definitely something I‚Äôll consider | Thank you üíú me toooo | As someone named Brett, I laugh at that poor soul. Her own existence as a woman with the same name is very validating for me  as a trans woman and she can't change that.

These grifters prey on your insecurities. Once you realize that they are chasing perceived problems than actual problems, it gives you a lot of strength. They're just making this shit up as they go, in the name of spreading hate. What a waste of energy. | ü§òüèªü§òüèª hell yes!!! I love that!! | Think again. In Florida you can have your license revoked if you have changed your gender on it. This is why I didn‚Äôt want to fucking post on here. You‚Äôre so detached from the issue that it‚Äôs all politics to you. I don‚Äôt want to debate I want someone to care about my feelings. | Blocked blocked blocked you both Wizlo and mmknance | ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | Yeah. A lot of those people are coming from a place of pain. They want to feel in control or better than something, so they view life as this unnecessary zero sum game. Kindness isnt money. There is no ledger tracking debts of kindness and such. 

There are always going to be people hurting. Or lost. And some, yeah, are just plain rude and awful. They make up these games everyone needs to live by. It'd be funny if it weren't so sad. | Can you imagine they even have my dream job and still can't even live the normal life that even a CNA could've lived back then come man what is going on in the world | Help me too üò£ | Hey man my dad who's a nurse makes money and when he was with my mom she was letting bills go and stuff so he was losing money it's just been since 2015 or so that hes been able to get on track being separated. And he's got money doesn't live bougie but lives like he wants goes where he wants.

Sometimes its about the circumstances and not just the money you make. 

That's why they always say you shouldn't make kids without being married etc üòÖ idk if this op case but | They are paid well lol I can't see a world well a nurse makes less then 32 a hour starting out. 

My dads been a nurse sknce 2005 when earnings were lower and right now he makes like 45 a hour | This the shit I be talking about bro nothing makes sense anymore | No but I was raised religious, Jehovah‚Äôs Witness to be exact. My mother always told me if I was a bad person, gay, or killed myself then I wouldn‚Äôt go to paradise when Armageddon comes. She‚Äôd guilt me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you wanna see nana and papa again? Don‚Äôt you love them?‚Äù Like fuck off. | I believe Jesus died for me. I try to study all religions so I'm educated best in the way I live. I don't fear God turning me away or judging me if I were to end my own life. He knows my heart and the way I've lived. I'm confident he shows love to the souls that can't take this planet. The ones that caused such misery on another soul should be fearful though. | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | [deleted] | My mom did made me and i told her she should have used a condom allready. Theire where many things that could have prevented the outcome peacfull options but no they all couldnt do it because they where egoistic assholes so i will have to do it myself. And oh boy if im gonna meet some stoopid bitch ass motherfucker scribbeling shit on a stone with the headline GREAT PLAN jeez i have some plans for this little bitch. | Then I'm curious what keeps you here | You're kinda asking the wrong questions I think or maybe not understanding something quite right. God doesn't make life anything, good or bad, we do. He doesn't micromanage every little thing, though some people erroneously believe he does, if that were true id tend to agree with you. As for why he'd make people be able to be suicidal, that kinda makes the same assumption ie that we are just some sort of moist robots that can't have a thought without God's input or say so, which again, simply isn't the case. At least if you have a traditional judeo Christian view of God | That's terrible | Honestly, I think that's an interesting way to think about it, idk if I fully agree or not, but I definitely think that's fair | Fair | Appreciate your honesty and empathy | Man that's terrible, I don't get how people ever think that's a good thing. I disagree with atheism being logical of course it's not, but at least you're not subject to that bullshit anymore | Can you expand on that a little bit, like what exactly makes you think that you'd still go to heaven? I'm not being abrasive I'm honestly asking | I feel ya bud, I'm not Muslim, but I get the fear | Fair | Like a samurai? | I feel that my friend, every single day | I'm Christian | In Islam you can get outta hell? What sura is that in, or is it in the Hadith? | What makes you say that, if you don't mind me asking | Few things here, 1-nobody is forced into suicide, it's always a choice even if it doesn't feel like it. And this is coming from someone who's attempted it and still struggles every single day to hold on. I suppose you can make an extreme example of like a family being held at gunpoint and the parents given an option to kill themselves or their kids, but I'd argue that's a murder and a choice to save lives. 
2- hell isn't torture, it's torment, and that's different.
3-Evil people accepting Jesus and going to heaven, well ya, that's everyone, we're all evil in some ways. Obviously not everyone is Hitler, but you don't have to teach a child to lie | [deleted] | Ah, I get that | These days I think that higher consciousness higher vibration stuff is just as much BS as unconditional love from a big daddy in the sky who condemns you to eternal torture for hit believing in it.  The reincarnation cycle in those theologies is just a never ending cycle of suffering then‚Äîthereby making this the cycle of eternal suffering and hell. Time to push the eject button then. | Lemme ask you something... Do you care at all what I have to say about your comment? Like are you at all interested in an intelligent, rational, calm, respectful response/conversation about this or are you just basically venting clearly emotional angry convictions? Cuz if you do care I'll gladly talk with you, if not I'll just respect your position and move on | Don't miss... I'm assuming you were raised in some religion and have since given it up or something | Fear of pain is very legitimate, I'm curious what you mean by kinda religious bc by the sound of your second comment, seems like you're more on the atheist or maybe apathetic side of the metaphysical | Bushido isn't really a religion as much as it's an ideology/philosophy, code of honor. Ronin had various religious beliefs inside of Bushido. That's pretty sick though, I love it. U Japanese? | Honestly man idk for sure, people have different opinions on it, some day is a straight ticket to hell, that if you truly trusted Jesus you wouldn't do it so bc you did proved you never trusted him, but that's bullshit. There's no place in the Bible that says that, there's only 1 thing that's called the unforgivable sin and suicide isn't it. I think God knows your heart and struggles and suicide is something that can be forgiven. He can, has and does forgive murder and suicide is self-murder | Ha well now I'm curious what your conspiracies are, but I won't pry. There's some things you said that sound interesting to me, but I won't press any further if that's not something you're interested in | Yep. That family member is the only person on this planet who loves me unconditionally. It's my 80-year-old grandma who keeps my hope alive.  My parents are both massive assholes with deep pockets who think they can buy their way into my life, and all my friends and the rest of my family members are not that loyal and will move on from my death in the blink of an eye. | I am speaking for myself and you and everyone, bc like it or not, we all do evil things. Nobody is 100% good. 
As far as torment being better, no I actually think it's worse, but it's not a punishment, it's a consequence.
But nothing you said refutes a single thing I said, not even close, it's clear you're just extremely emotional and angry about these things and honestly I don't blame you. Life is hell and it sucks and it sounds like yours sucks exponentially more, you've been thru and go thru a lot of pain and I'm sorry for that, but a lot of people suffer at a comparable level and even worse and yet think the opposite of you. 
But honestly this isn't why I made this post, I didn't do it in some bullshit attempt to witness to people, I did it bc I struggle with it too and I honestly wanted to know if I was alone. I'm not interested in arguments or trying to convert anyone that doesn't agree with me | No it doesn't | Ah so the answer to my question is clearly no. That's fine, didn't really expect anything else | Sounds like you're a very ""seeing is believing"" kind of person
And by apathetic side of metaphysical I just meant you're apathetic to the proposition of God's existence, but based off what you just said in this comment, that doesn't seem to be the case since you said you need there to be a God. However maybe you're apathetic to which God that is, just so long as there is one | That's cool though, just don't go commiting seppuku anytime soon | Meh I wouldn't really say that's a conspiracy theory, that's the position of a lot of people. Here's what confuses me about that though, you say you've been studying for years... Idk exactly what you mean by that bc if that's true, there's no way you could actually believe all religions are the same. Any simple study of even the so called ""big 3"" abrahamic religions is enough to show that's not true. | Well hopefully nothing ever does. Come what may, go with honor | Ya I don't have any desire to change your mind either, don't really care, just thought it was interesting | Nice, I do believe you do | Anytime, feel free to DM me if you ever do feel like getting into it, with respect of course | I'd work the most horrible minimum wage slave job for the rest of my life, if that meant i could escape chronic pain. | You know, it's 12 am, I was downing my antidepressants with alcohol and something told me to go back to Reddit. Your comment touched me deeply because despite me dying in the river, I've wanted to die by the sea.

And ""I'd rather find myself in many situations, except ""dead"" - the thing is I did. For many years. Now I'm addicted to alcohol and meds. I did go to psychiatrist, and everything to keep myself alive. If you knew my life you would think that the best choice for me is to die. Because I'm hurting my loved ones anyway. My mother, I don't have many but she counts as 100. My disorder has destroyed me and I have fallen in the deepest of pits.

If I even tried to leave the alcohol I would absolutely be nobody. Because I can't even take a call without having panic attacks. So thank you brother from your sister in pain. It's the best for everyone. | Thinking about my failed life, and preparing for my plan. | Mental illness isn't a competition. | I pressed it. But my plan is more satisfying. | My brother was a drug addict and this person has the nerve to suggest me to do this shit and talks about pure love. | Nobody said it is. | It's long story and it is what it is. Big part isn't my fault because I have a disorder, but also I made some wrong choices. 

But I will be happiest when I'm at peace. | Directed at the asshole, nothing to do with you aye. Hope you're okay. | Your comments are so nauseating, that killing myself is even more appealing. Instead of pushing people to do worse, do something better with your life. | No, I can't. I tried but it was too late. | I've already tried. And at least I can say that I didn't wish harm to people or called them nuts. | You‚Äôre not the problem, it‚Äôs your environment, the people, institutions etc. Get on a cruise to an Island in the Caribbeans and watch your life change or Bali or any place cheap with sunshine. Literally restart everything. Just save up a little and GO. At least try this before taking your life. Experience a different environment, do it for a random stranger on the internet. | I don't have money to go on trips. I can't even go for a walk without someone because I'm agoraphobic. Years of meds didn't help either. | I'm in pain which goes on and on. You can't understand that. And for that reason, it's unreasonable to you. | First of all, I'm not American. Secondly, who are you to judge my life or my decisions when you don't even know me? | What pure love? Offering someone drugs is pure love? Gtfo | You don't know what love is. I'd rather shoot myself than being drug addict. | I will not say anything but all the best | Hey girl - I was a stripper living out of my car for 8 months. I'm housed and in school again. It does get better | [deleted] | 32F- agreed | [deleted] | highly relate üôÇ | You see me. Thank you | Weltschmerz is one of my favorite words. Thank you for mentioning it.¬† | It is hard. Thank you for sharing | How do you cope with 1&2? 
To elaborate a little more on 3‚Ä¶
Human beings are social animals and will die in isolation. I have a hard time finding any people to connect with at deep enough levels who are devoted to doing everything necessary to maintain that connection. No seems to value and prioritize connection like I do | Yes, exactly. That‚Äôs a major problem I‚Äôve had my entire life. Being understood is essential to human survival. No one has had the capacity to understand me or the depth of intimacy (love) I require. 

I agree. What would make me feel loved and cared for is reciprocity. Someone that is devoted to remaining connected and won‚Äôt shrink back or avoid what that requires. 


One of my favorite poems is The invitation by Oriah Mountain Dreamer | üòå | Pain is a mode to connect, not a justification to turning away | I resonante deeply with everything you say. You have a true talent for observation and putting things into words.¬† | Have you ever struggled to accept ? What keeps you going, living, striving? How have you avoided being found? When you say no one has rejected you more than you. What does that look like for you? | Thank you. It‚Äôs really hard having the capacity to understand others and having to accept that they cannot reciprocate without falling into a despairing pit. It makes nearly every interaction feel one sided | That sounds extremely and painfully hard. I appreciate your honesty. So the people pleasing mask doesn‚Äôt come off for anyone? You mentioned in comment previously ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never allowed myself to be found‚Äù. How does that manifest ? Is that referring to your nature to people please and hide your true feelings? | Do you not find comfort in having your true feelings validated? 


I can see how your inability to perceive yourself wholeheartedly is problematic because I can already tell you haven‚Äôt failed at every metric | I see, that makes complete sense. I feel like I understand where you‚Äôre coming from now. That‚Äôs fucking terrible. Have you tried any other treatment modalities? | I can understand that, more than you‚Äôd probably expect. Are you open to a suggestion? Maybe you‚Äôve tried it and I would be interested in knowing what your experience with it was like. | I‚Äôve considered ECT myself. How do you feel about it? | God good luck! It's going to be alright even if she has to go to the hospital first! I believe it! Don't get mad you guys will get through it!

I am constantly being threatened with forced marriage. I hate them so much, I don't know how long I can go without trying to kill them. I thought I could get more time to prepare for an escape from this, but even now I am being threatened with forced marriage. I am at the end of my rope. I tried slitting my wrist today. I did research all day, then I tried slitting my wrist for like 2 hours straight but it didn't go anywhere deep. I don't know what to do. I will slitting again, but I am considering getting in an accident or something. I didn't want that, but I don't see a lot of options.",u/Ambitious_Break7786,43,"Thank you. When I first wrote here, I felt that even if people said comforting things after all its not going to change anything. But it has helped. Truly. | Thanks. I will contact them. | I want to. I don't have a job or money. And this is India. Its really unsafe for women. No relative or anyone will take me in, they are all the same. I would be happy to take a job cleaning or waitressing or whatever, but I can't do that while living here. I tried online jobs but there is so much household work I couldn't keep up with it. 
And I can't exactly report them for threatening marriage when nothing is concrete now. It will just lead to more trouble. I just need some help. I don't know what I can do. | I think I will tomorrow. But a lot of people say that most of those are not helpful here in India. I saw a girl on quora saying that she was dragged back by police even though she is an adult. | That takes money. I would need quite a sum if I was to move out of here. So I will need a well paying job, and adequate time. But they keep pushing me until I can't take no more. They push me to desperation. Even now I am planning on drowning or getting in an accident. Thanks for the recommendation. I will check it out | That is so horrible. Did you try contacting the police? I hope you are safe now. I saw some people suggest St. Broseph to me, and from what I have seen he seems legit. He is on reddit if you want to check out. Please don't let that ""father"" be in your life anymore. | My parents won't let me have a job like waitressing or anything. I am trying on the job front, but it could take some time. They keep me busy with housework and I don't have too much time. Also can't do a job while studying is another rule. I keep taking the abuse and the restrictions, but then they start pushing my buttons again. Its like they want me to do something desperate. | I don't really know. India is not as bad as I know some places are, but I have read some people on quora saying that help agencies don't really help, and sometimes if you leave, the police drag you back. Ideally, I would save enough to leave, but sometimes I get despondent thinking what if I don't have time to do all that, and then think of just ending it. | Thank you. That seems like my exact situation. I have been wanting to get out of here for as long as I can remember. | No. I can't leave the country, that would require too much money, my parents don't have that. Also, they won't really let me go that far away. I just hope I can get ny JRF and then focus on P. Hd applications. Then maybe I won't need that much money to get away. | The worst thing is that she hates my father. I don't blame her but it hurts when you sympathise with someone only for them to turn around and invalidate your troubles. | Thank you. I do feel way better just talking to all the people here. Thank you all for commenting. | Thanks. I don't even want that much. I take all the abuse, I take the restrictions. But still they have to keep threatening to destroy me. All I want is the chance to be happy. | Thank you. I do have a plan actually. Its very detailed, lol. I searched up stuff like train tickets and rent. Now I just need a decent job, and enough time to save up. | That's my plan. I just get super depressed because what if they try to marry me off before that? Then I have no option other than suicide. Yesterday, again there were threats made and more abusive words, and I felt so depressed. | Its not about my emotions. I have been keeping them in check for my whole life. Its about them threatening to force me into marriage. Now I do have plans to get a job and save up enough to leave, but I need time for that. If they try to force me before that, then I will be pushed to do something even more desperate. It scares me. It does. I don't want to do it. But talking to people here has lifted the weight a little. | Thank you so much. Your kind words mean a lot. I didn't think words could help me get out of the blackness I was enveloped in last night, but they have helped tremendously. | Thanks. I will surely reach out. I do have plans to move out, I just want to know if help would be available if I am in a dire situation. | Since my childhood I have stuck out as I was so socially awkward. At that time I didn't know there were others like me. My parents like to think they are very progressive so they will let me get an education and a career. Like I wouldn't mind so much, if they would just leave me alone for a while. They keep saying you can get an education, a job, etc. etc. Then they will turn around and say we need to get you married soon. I get so angry at these times I feel like I could hit them. Its not enough that I can't ever my feelings, or that I am told all the time that as a woman my job is to be the family slave. They habe to also hammer in that I don't have the right to my own life. Consent is where I draw the line. The other things I can deal with in the hopes that I can leave someday, but that is what enrages me so much. | Thank you for your comment. I do have a plan. As of now, I want to get enough money then leave to another state, and then hopefully I will get a job and be able to support myself. I just also need another exit plan. Like if something happens and I can't control it.

Thanks for your comment. | Trouble is i don't live in bangalore. I am so glad you escaped it. I hope I can too someday | I know. I told them that I read about how the Prophet pbuh, said that just such a marriage was invalid because the girl was forced into it. They just don't care. They are such hypocrites, they don't follow their own religion. | I don't think they will give me asylum just because I am depressed and my family is emotionally and verbally abusive. Especially with all the immigration stuff going on at the moment. But I am trying to leave this place. Just need enough money, job and time to save up. | I don't know any black magic. | I don't want to. I am scared that I will be put in Hell because of this. But these people keep pushing me until I can see no way out. | Yeah. The most upsetting thing is its not even Islam, its just these people who are bad. | I don't want to trust another person, as it might lead to more harm than good. But I have talked to so many kind people today. This has given me more hope to continue fighting. | Thank you. Some people have linked some shelters and organisations. I will try. | I know. They know too. But they don't care. I always knew they were hypocritical. But I didn't know they would ignore the teachings of their own religion. | Ohh that sounds cool. I am trying to get a scholarship. In my country its called JRF. Its given if you qualify an exam and then get admission in a phd program. I would still need some money, because I have heard it takes some time for the bureaucracy to start kicking in. Thank you for your kindness. I hadn't thought it would help at first, but it has helped me be a little less scared and anxious than I was all day long. | They have spies everywhere. My family here is very extensive. I once went to a mall close to my college and someone told them. Going behind their backs might just make my life much harder. Also, I am pretty much stuck at home right now, as my studies are done. I am trying for a Phd, and if that doesn't work then a B. Ed. | Relatives are all the same. And my friends might sympathise, but they live with their families too, so I can't exactly ask them. Their parents would probably sympathise with mine. I am hoping to get my scholarship, and then I can hopefully move to another state. If not then I will have to just keep trying. Scholarship would solve a lot of issues. | Legally, they should help. But in real life, I have seen some accounts of people saying that they don't help. | I feel fine now. Not suicidal certainly. And planning for my exit. | I do want to. Just as soon as I enough money. | Thanks. | I wear a headscarf. I am not even allowed to wear jeans with shirts or anything.

u/Anni_88,115,"Goodbye letter because I have no one else to write it to ‚ö†Ô∏èTW: abuse, r@pe

I've made my decision and my consciousness is clear. I tried my very best since the age of 7 and I did everything to make something good out of my life, and most importantly, to recieve love. 

Didn't happen. Not even my family could love me, never had the luck of having friends or the blessing of a partner. 

As a newborn already my father wanted me dad because I was born half-paralyzed. My mother never loved me or stood out for me when my father abused me over the years. She almost drowned me as well on purpose. I hid in our garden and ran away several times, I asked other family members to please help. They silenced me.

People I thought are friends betrayed me, humiliated me and left me in the worst times of my life.

Guys and men... Other than being called ugly and Gollum by them, and being r@ped, nothing. Romantic love was the last hope of my life after all the trauma that happened and life refused to give me this one thing as well.

I accomplished things, I tried to find a safe haven in education, hobbies and sports, and successfully won competitions, wrote five books and several short stories. Some got published and won a university competition too, when I wasn't even 16 yet. But no matter these 'materialistic' accomplishments or successes, I always, whole my life never felt happy. Not once. No matter the ""kindhearted spirit"" (as someone said) of mine, no matter the socialization. There was no one to smile at me or hug me. There was no one to care about me. People used me to help them then threw me away when they got well. 

I'm utterly defeated. I can find nothing anymore to hold onto and all my hope died. 

My birthday is coming in 7 days and I can't force myself anymore to live and face the shame of another year passing with pure abuse and humiliation and s3xual abuse. 

I can't force myself to live anymore and no one f*cking cares that I will die.

Goodbye to everyone who never even knew I was in trouble, and goodbye to those who very well knew and did not help. 

And please, if you read it this far, check on your friends and loved ones. You never know what they might be going through. You might save someone with your kindness.

Goodbye.

And I know that, in certain situations, some people do wish to be the opposite sex. I'd just feel more comfortable as female, personally | Well, since I am biologically a man, I can speak on this. And please note, this isn't me trying to downplay the things that women go through. First, I'll start off with the fact that when men have issues, they're typically told to suck it up and deal with it, which leads into the reason why men's suicide rates are so high, and they're less likely to seek medical attention due to societal norms that discoruage them from doing so. In workplaces, specifically when working with women, they're at constant risk of being falsely accused of SA, simply because one of the female employees doesn't like him, and that's thanks to MeToo (Believe all women), which has ruined the lives of many men, and, even when found innocent years later, 9 times of out 10, the women suffers zero repercussions and gets to continue like it never happen. Meanwhile, the guy who's been falsely accused has now been brought to the brink of suicide, because people will always see him as a rapist of some sort. Many men isolate themselves when they feel like they can't live up to the expectations society has placed upon them. Many men are constantly screwed over during divorces, 70% of which are initiated by women, especially if they have kids. And now men, and even husbands, may have to worry about their lives being taken by liberals because they don't like the current president, despite those men supposedly being seen as the dangerous ones in society. Again, not trying to overshadow women's issues, because I'm aware many of them are also victims of society. But just because I'm a transfem, doesn't mean I can't acknowledge the unappreciated effort that men put into building our society into what it is today.

u/Appropriate_Table191,494,"I was repeatedly raped by my father as a child and I'm seriously considering suicide now  I have memories from as far back as I can recall of being molested by my father. I used to sleep with my parents when I was little. Every night he would put his hands inside my pant and rub my vagina. He would make me hold his dick. Sometimes he'd get on top of me, take off my shirt and put his mouth on my breasts that weren't even developed yet. I was younger than 8 years old. He would try to push himself into me but it didn't completely penetrate most probably because it would take a lot of force and mom would wake up.

My parents loved - and still love - me so hard, it makes me hurt inside. I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense? I refuse to look for romantic love because the only people I want to care about are them. The more years I spend masking my true self (because nobody - nobody - would ever suspect I‚Äôm like this; me, the attractive, successful career woman who has bought her own apartment and been living independently for over ten years), the more I want to give it all up and just move back in with them and totally regress. I want to regress to the age I was when I didn‚Äôt know of negative emotions, or anxiety, of grief and loss. I want to be ignorant. I am both saddened and filled with rage that growing up happened. I want it to be just the three of us forever. To play with Barbies with my dad in the garden. I want to see colours as brightly as I used to. I want my mum to hold me tight. The love I experienced in my childhood is like a chokehold. On a bad day, old memories is all I can think about. I cycle through them in my brain and cry until I have no voice left.

Nobody asked me if I wanted to be an adult. Nobody checked with me. I watch my friends get married and have kids and I‚Äôm like why. Why do you want to adult so badly? How sad that you are now taking care of your own children. You should still be children yourselves. Why the fuck are we getting older?

And then, because everyone seems to be going down that path, I start thinking ‚ÄòWhat gene am I missing that I turned out so wrong?‚Äô

I would like to die a dignified death with my parents in a couple of decades‚Äô time. I can hold on till then if I know I get to go with them.

we get to the hospital and they give me pain meds, so i was out of it, but i had to get multiple stitches, and wrists bandages.

I can never have kids. The boys parents feel bad for me and wish they didn‚Äôt call the police but it doesn‚Äôt matter. The worst part is that I love him.

2. I can‚Äôt convince the parents to drop charges. Unfortunately that‚Äôs not how that works. They‚Äôve already asked the police not to charge me, but it‚Äôs up to the prosecutor now. Not them. 
3. I don‚Äôt think I did anything morally terrible. I didn‚Äôt hurt him. I gave him love and support while he was with me. I still don‚Äôt blame him. He has had a very difficult life. I just hope he doesn‚Äôt blame himself for whatever happens to me forever. 
4. I have a decent lawyer, but he‚Äôs not too hopeful. It doesn‚Äôt matter if he lied. I‚Äôm the idiot who fell for his lies. I‚Äôm the idiot who fell in love with him. I‚Äôm the idiot who ruined their own life.

My current role is to support clients before, during, and for 2 years after their discharge. The role was created to reduce suicides and to prevent readmissions

I can't cope anymore. It isn't my work  - it's everything else. I don't want to be blind. I don't want to depend on others. I don't want to have Bipolar, GAD, and PTSD. This isn't the life I chose or magined.

I'm struggling so much, and I feel like I don't deserve to be here. I feel so worthless, despairing, exhausted, and helpless. It feels like my existence has never really  mattered. I feel like I wasn't made to be here. I'm invisible to the people around me.

I feel like my life has run it's course and I hope that no one else here has to experience this pain. 

I can understand why some of my clients made the choice to end their lives, and I hope they found the peace they were looking for.

I've been gathering means over the last few months. Everything is so hard.

My clients are so valued and needed. They deserve the world and every possible positive experience. Each one of them has a bright, unique light that I know will guide them through their darkest times. I hope they know/knew how much I care(d)

(Important note!!!: I am a porn addict, since when I was 11, but I always tried to be careful of what I was watching)



I‚Äôm 15 (turning 16 this year) and it has been a month since I started having troubles with this, and I don‚Äôt even know anymore, about anything at this point.

Nothing like that happened to me, I‚Äôve been staring at kids, and I didn‚Äôt knew if I felt pleasure from it, and when I started thinking that I did, I started going crazy (all of this in 1-3 days). 
I started forcing myself to vomit, skipping school days, and everything (I study in a school full of children). And the problem is that never anything like this ever happened to me. I started having this disgusting thoughts and I don‚Äôt know what to do with them. In the beginning of all of this, I started felling so fucking disgusted, I wanted to actually vomit and i would go to the bathroom all time in class, but now, I can‚Äôt even feel disgusted anymore, and I just want to fucking suffer because of this. 

It comes to a point where, when I don‚Äôt feel disgusted about these thoughts, I just want someone or something to make me fell horrible, and hate myself. Because I don‚Äôt know what I feel. I don‚Äôt know if I like them, and if I like them, I wanna suffer from this liking. I cried in shower today because I just want to suffer and suffer so bad.

Today, I saw a 12 year old girl (probably) and I thought she was pretty and I felt so bad for this. (it was mid the basketball game I had today) I wanted to cry so much because of that. 
I wanted to hug someone, because my mother‚Äôs hugs are not working anymore. 

I block myself from looking at the streets or maybe looking at some kid walking, or someone younger, because I‚Äôm scared of what I might fell or whatever. 
I want to be alone, not be in society no more because I‚Äôm scared of what I can do, I stopped trying to learn 3D modeling because I‚Äôm scared of what I might search on my PC. 

I was playing with my dog now, and I remembered ‚Äúoh shit, you‚Äôre having a good time, stop that‚Äù but now, I‚Äôm sad I can‚Äôt have a good time, and not because I might be a pedo‚Ä¶I think you know where this goes.

Well, I‚Äôm scared, I don‚Äôt know what to do, I want to die but I‚Äôm scared about it, I want to suffer but I don‚Äôt know If I deserve it, I don‚Äôt know nothing anymore. 

I wish I could be more worried about this.

I talked to my therapist about all of this and she said I am not a pedophile, and for some reason, I thought that was a ‚Äúlose‚Äù for me, but I should he cheering and everything, but for some reason, I was kinda sad about it, I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs good

I bought most of the things I need to kill myself.I am very, very, very, very, very sad! I know this is going to devastated a bunch of people. Please please please pray that Jesus will have mercy on my soul!! Little over 4 months ago I was severely and very seriously attacked by someone suffering from dementia. I also picked up some very everything's not long after. I have 24/7 completely unbearable pain. Even very strong pain medication does nothing. I am very serious ligament and cartilage damage. Cartilage isn't something that can heal and my country doesn't provide very advanced treatments. I can barely use my arms to do anything. Had to stop working because of my severe injuries and pain. üíîEven the most simplest and easiest house chores gives me pain. Just holding a cup of coffee in my hand gives me pain in my elbow.Both my shoulder, both my elbows, both my thumbs, both my knees, my upper and lower back is very, very damaged and in more pain that you will ever believe. It's permanent injuries and the pain will drive any person on the planet to insanity. I've always managed to cope in any situation. But not being able to use my arms without extreme pain, not being able to help my very old parents, not being able to take walks, not being able to play with my sister's children and not being able to experience any form of Joy anymore. Are things I cannot live with and will never ever be able to make peace with. I know I'm being punished for a lifetime of addictions and not having a proper relationship with Jesus. I will give up everything I own and sleep on the floor for the rest of my life if I could be painfree again and use my arms like a normal person. The physical pain has gotten so, so, soooooo bad that I cry most days because of the intensity of the painüò≠ the only thing that can perhaps give a little bit of improvement for my very severe injuries.Is growth hormone or stem cell therapy. Both therapies has its risks. Lot of stem cell therapy is not legit and there is even been cases where people went blind. Rather, human growth hormone (HGH) is proven to treat joint problems rather than cause them. Research shows that following the administration of HGH: 93% of studied patients experienced ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù results from HGH injections as a treatment for joint-related problems.

It's bad if you can't use your arms. I am pretty convinced I'm on the Wrath of God for a lifetime of addictions( not drugs though). I did confess and ask God to forgive me with the precious blood of Jesus Christ. It's stuff that started when I was very very little and that crazy early exposure to bad stuff. You sound like a wonderful person. It's bad if pain medicine does nothing and start eating and burning your stomach. I will give up everything I own if I could just be paying free again and use my arms and legs like a normal person. I've stopped going out completely except for going to buy the necessities. My shoulders and elbows are destroyed on the inside. It's truly scary stuff. I hope you experience God's love and peace. Please ask God to return HIS mercy to me. I can't erase the past. But if I could live my life over I would do almost everything different and make Jesus number one priority. Take extra special care and thank you once again for your reply | Thank you!,thank you!

But try taking 30 mg of zinc for 6 months. You never know. Also look into eyesight research. You've got nothing to lose and zinc is also crazy good for your skin and testosteroneüòÄ | Thanks. I wish I could talk to God face-to-face. I have questions about why HE made me and more. I will also ask HIM. What must I sacrifice to get healing. I will give up anything to get healed from my serious injuries. I wonder if anybody in history has ever been so seriously injured in their cartilage and ligaments and truly, truly got completely healed. Stay special | Thank you for taking the time to type a reply. Cartilage and serious rotator calf injuries can not heal.I promised GOD if HE heals me I'll give my testimony in many Churches.

I can't work anymore and I don't have a lot of money. Nothing gives me pain relief. Not even cortisone injections( which destroys cartilage more by the way) or CBD or opioid medication. I would need very special, rare and advanced treatment just to perhaps get a little bit of relief.If possible. If God were to heal me of all my serious injuries. I would want to live again. The pain and the disability that comes with it is just too extreme. Thank you for caring and please know that I appreciate your effort. It feels like there's a bunch of knives stuck in my upper back. Went for some physio and now it's even much worse. Wish I had millions to get all kinds of treatments overseas. | Perhaps there's a very small chance. It will be complicated and difficult The only two  procedure that I know of that might give some relief and a small percentage of healing is gross hormone injections directly into the injuries at stem cell therapy which is very dodgy and difficult to know if a place is truly the chat and honestly licensed. Besides I will need repeated treatments and I can't even work anymore. How to need a place to stay at I think it will be very complicated getting a visa because I won't know when I will be coming back. My life has become a nightmare that I can't wake up off. I don't even go to friends anymore. The pain and the new disabilities is just too much.Pain medication doesn't do a thingüíî | Thank you.

Can't even wash my car or vacuum anymoreüò¨üò±ü§¶üèª | I was very severely attacked by a strong person suffering from dementia and couldn't sleep for almost a month and did some exercise to make myself tired to fall asleep. But I haven't done that kind of exercise for 7 years. Cartilage and ligaments got injured and some existing injuries was damaged even moreüò≠üò≠ Absolutely nothing helps for the pain and I am constantly getting very loud shooting noises from my knees, elbows and shoulders. My upper back hurt so much I even cry sometimes. No personal will be able to handle this amount of pain | The cheap Healthcare is very, very bad and if you are white you're very rarely get good help. Besides there are only very basic treatments and nothing advanced. The specialists only give ok help and attention to the rich. My injuries are very extreme. I will need very advanced and alternative treatments. Which isn't available here. But I don't even know if that will help much. Many years ago I had to stop working because of a doctor's negligence daring a operation. The government didn't want to give me any money whatsoever. So I started a business. God blessed the business. Although I was making much, much less money. Now with my extreme new injuries. I had to stop my business. I'll be ashamed to tell you where I get money now. This is the last country in the world you want to be white and poor. Don't ever be fooled about what you read about this country in the media. Our government tells more lies and is more corrupt and racist then you can ever, ever imagine. Americans will fall out their chairs if they know what's going on in this country. I get information from reliable sources. Like ex police woman and organizations that spread the true statistics about crime and what about things our government is doing and trying to do.

u/Death_Prophet83,167,"Lost the woman of my dreams and tried it. Monday night I was texted my girl, she was out with her friend so I figured I would leave them in peace so I told her I loved her and asked her to hit me up when she got home. She replied she would and said she loved me. After an hour or so after I figured she would be home (roughly 6 hours later) I sent her a few messages, after the fourth one I sent one another saying I hope the reason your not replying is because you are safe driving. Immediately she responded no I've been home about an hour. She then tried accusing me of manipulating her, lying to her, just trying to get an easy fuck. I hadn't been doing any of that, but no matter what I said she wouldn't pick up the phone so we could have a real conversation. Then she said a generic goodbye and said she had to go she had work early. I couldn't believe it, I had no idea what happened, we went from planning a future together one day, to done the next. 

I was devastated, I hadn't felt that way about someone in 20 years (I'm 41m, she 43f) I had been living in the darkness for at least 10 years thinking my disabilities made it so I would never be happy again. She had pulled me out of the dark, I felt hope again, felt butterflies in my chest thinking about our future together, it all went away in an instant, it felt like the darkness came back with such a fury it would never go away again. 

So that night I took my pain meds and my anxiety meds and a quart of alcohol, while sending her a goodbye video while doing it. Then I lied down and went to sleep knowing by the time she woke up and saw it, it would be over. 

Well not much after I had fallen asleep I was awoken to three police officers and a firemen in my bedroom. I saw them and said fuck it didn't work yet. They told me the had gotten a call about a message I sent online, I thought shit, she woke up and checked her messages. Well they rushed me to the hospital and I got pumped and flushed, then had to sit there under observation for 7 hours while they monitored my heart rate. 

I told them I would not stay at the behavioral health facility there at the hospital, no shot. So they said I had to work with the crisis center people and have a safety plan to be released, so I had my mother come and be my safety supervisor. She found out from the police lieutenant that was on scene the had received the info from the FBI, apparently my SA video flagged their system and they alerted local PD to do a welfare check. I never knew that was a thing.

u/Earl_NottingHam,250,"Best friend cheated on me with my girlfriend. So i have a new juicy story for y'all to gloat on & wonder if i'm going to survive or not.

But first some back story.  
I met my friend in high school, he was always someone who no one could get along with and there were so many rumors going on about him at the time, that everyone pretty much warned me, don't go with this guy. For the sake of the story let's call him. Jake.

Despite the warnings, i still became friends with Jake, at the time i felt like he was misunderstood. But very blunt statements against women and racist jokes here & there which i didn't tolerate. We were friends for over 6-7 years. He's also much older than i am. He's 29 and i'm 26. 

He knew i was dating several women from time to time on the internet & i wanted to meet up with these people a couple of times. But it never worked out. Until the one from Poland came around. Now everything at first seemed to work out. Like she liked me, she liked Jake & it was a good friend group that we had going. There were some isssues between her and Jake. But this also resolved later on in life. 

I formed a relationship with her. Let's call her Zo√´. Psuedo names though. Not their real names. Zo√´ is specific because of a past friend of Jake, she looks like a Zo√´ he knows. So there's a bit of petty revenge there i guess. 

Zo√´ is a girl from poland who's strictly on meds. She has certain conditions for her mood etc.  
Depression and other stuff. Now I formed a relationship with her and the first week was smooth sailing until long story short my friend Jake. My best and only friend that i have. Is fucking Zo√´ and Zo√´ doesn't care.

Right in front of my eyes too. Like, I just fucking dropped a bomb. So to leave you with all the boring details. She's now with him. But her meds are still here & boy, let me tell you.  
These meds are powerful, i can pretty much go into coma tonight. Because they're prescriptive meds from her doctor. 

I don't care what happens anymore, other than the fact i'll have a feast in heaven. By the revenge that is afterwards. I also can't take the pain, i'm weak for that. Besides, i also paid everything for her to even come to my place. Tickets, food, expenses everything. I'm livid. But i don't see a future without them. So i'm ending and hoping i can reincarnate for a better life. 

TLDR: Best & only friend cheated on me with my gf. Gf has meds, i'll use for a trip to heaven. ",u/Earl_NottingHam,1,"Hey there's an update. I did take the meds, i took like 20 tablets that night. I vomited, heard hallucinations & i was waiting for them at the front door at midnight. No one came in, because they weren't sure i was going to open the door. I let them know that i took her medicine. That was wrong off me.  
I'm still having symptoms but i'm trying to detox from it. 

My best friend, he came and talked things out with me the day after tomorrow. I've been a shitty boyfriend, there were things that i did that, looking back at the relationship were not okay. I have anger issues. Not severe, but it still would hurt people when it is from a difference of opinion. There's also the trash talking that i do, whenever someone has a difference of opinion i take that anger and push it onto someone else. I'm trying to learn from this break up. I'm also trying to make amends, so i'm paying them back. I'm mostly afraid of being alone. 

I will go to family at sunday, to talk things through again. But srsly, i need to stop directing hate onto others & be more mature. I'm completely at fault here. I'm just glad my friend still accepts me. I'll try and help them out as much as possible.

u/EarthPoppins,93,"""it gets better"" ...when though? I've been suicidal on/off for 9 years now. Every time it ""got better"" it was temporary. Something always happened again that brought all the feelings and thoughts back up again. 
My whole life has been and still is just trauma after trauma. It never stops. 
I don't think I need therapy or any kind of depression treatment. I don't think my depression is the main issue here as I wouldn't even be depressed if it wasn't for what is my life. I think my depression is just my brain's response to what is and has been   my life. If my life wasn't this way, it'd truly get better, but that's out of my control.

When I've posted about it before I either got no replies or all the replies were just something like ""I feel for you"" and ""I'm sorry"" I've even left two therapists speechless before.
Not a single resource can help me, or I can't access it, I've already extensively looked into them all. It's not my mental health or suicidality that is the problem.

I already have some friends, but it's like there's a void inside my heart. No matter how much attention I get, I always want more.

u/Emotional_Nerve7628,172,"My life has hit rock bottom... Starting all the way back in the beginning of 2024 I thought my life was going great I just bought a house and I had a stable job. Life was good. Then comes Feb 5th my grandpa died and I loved him dearly. It was a quick passing he knew it was coming and even told me he knew it. I'm glad I got to talk to him for a while a day or so before he died. 

Then comes my bday Feb 21st. I get a call from my job telling me theyre firing me while I'm off. I thought no big deal I've got my parents to help out and I should find something relatively quick to at least somewhat pay for bills while I find better. I apply for unemployment and we were fine as my fianc√© had just gotten a refund from her college for a few grand. Then comes 2nd week of March. Unemployment said they need 8-10 weeks to decided if they can even give me money or not. I thought no big deal I'll find something or somewhere to work. 

March 21st comes... My dad gets into a motorcycle accident. He had his spleen removed due to it rupturing, had part of his skull removed to relieve pressure on the brain and is in a medically induced coma. The doctors told us he might not make it. This was very hard on my and immediate family. 

Then at the very end of March I get a call telling me a company wants to hire me and they offered me MUCH more than I was previously making at my last job. I was so excited and I thought everything was going to be ok. I was going to get caught up on bills and start saving... WRONG at the very end of April after I had alr done everything the company had me do like a physical, drug test, background check. Normal things. I called on the 30th thinking I was going to get hired very soon and they ended up telling me they cut 3 of those positions and I was one of them luckily I called or I would've never known. So Im frantically looking for a job now. Luckily my dad is doing better I'm very thankful for that. He's in rehab and doing much better but still has some brain injury things going on like memory etc.

May rolls around and im still looking for a job. I've applied for SIX HUNDRED JOBS IN THE PAST 3 1/2 MONTHS AND 1200 SINCE NOV OF 2023 NO ONE IS HIRING I GUESS?!??!??!
I've had as many interviews as I have fingers on my hands. So idfk what's going on. I've applied for everything. Even shit jobs and no response. 

Im in so much debt I don't even know where to begin to start paying stuff off. No job havent heard anything from unemployment. Although I will say this the company that originally offered me a job got me another interview with them tomorrow and I swear to God if I don't get it I genuinely might kill myself. Everything is going so wrong and it's just all too much for me right now I just need one thing to go right PLEASE...

I know it would be very selfish to do this because I have a beautiful fianc√© and dog. My mom just had her dad die and now my dad is in bad shape. So I know that wouod just kill her if I did kms. Im just venting because I don't want to dump all this on my fianc√© plus she already knows that I'm having super rough time on and to top it all off her parents are mad at me for getting laid of and not having a job yet. I don't think older people who have been at a job for 20 years understand how bad the job market is rn. Alr that is all for now.

u/Fair-Muscle-6710,135,"All I do is dream I'm a 31 year old guy that never figured out how to become an adult. I hit all the points that made sense till I became an adult. I dated in highschool and had a bunch of friends. After that it began to fall apart. 

I was single after highschool but became afraid to meet new people and interact. Slowly my friends dwindled or went to live their lives. Start new families. Start new careers. I remained stagnant. Couldn't hold down a job and never and still never feel good enough.

I tell myself when I have money I will start trying to date again, but my self confidence is destroyed. I live in perpetual stagnation, but time still progresses. I just don't feel like I have any other choice. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this. Maybe to hold myself accountable and put it out rather than letting it fester in my mind as my insomnia holds me hostage into the sunrise.

Nobody feel the need to respond. I just wanted to see if anyone else felt that way or maybe had some idea on what I could do. I just feel the loneliness taking hold and feel myself being pushed to that dark edge of reality. All I do is dream of a new life in a new world where I can be and do what I want to do since I feel like it's too late for me now.

I'm not a fan of being bullied by bosses either which goes hand in hand with not being able to hold down a job. The struggle is truly real.

I want to be completely female and be able to be pregnant. The idea of wearing clothes and makeup that fit me more is a good idea and have always wanted to do that but am worried about people finding out. | I don‚Äôt want to be trans. I want to have been born female. I can not have the life I want to matter what. | I wish I could transition, I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôd never even pass. I begged my parents as teen to let me go on puberty blockers over and over again, attempted suicide over it but they still wouldn‚Äôt let me. They kept talking about what if I regretted it or the long term side effects and how I was too young to make the decision or would grow out of gender dysphoria. Even when I kill myself they will blame mental illness instead of themselves. I don‚Äôt even want them to feel bad when I die and that‚Äôs the reason I haven‚Äôt killed myself yet. There so anti trans and are completely convinced everyone who transitions will kill themselves a few years after. I‚Äôve already made the decision to go through with suicide. I thought about leaving a note telling them how much I hate them for what they did to me but I still can‚Äôt bring myself to hurt them. | I don‚Äôt think they are awful. They are doing what they think is best for me even if it may be hurting me. They do love me. | I truly hope the best for you. Transitioning just can‚Äôt work for me, I don‚Äôt want to loose my family. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd even pass. | I think everyone is skipping the part where I said I don‚Äôt want to transition, I want to be born female. It‚Äôs impossible and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm suicidal. | I wouldn‚Äôt pass. And on top of that, would loose all my family, friends, job, ability to reproduce and still wouldn‚Äôt be female. | I have everything to loose. My family, friends, job, ability to reproduce. And even after all of that, I still won‚Äôt pass. I feel like a sick joke has been played on me. Even if I did transition I would still have to live years more a man in order to have the opportunity to do so and I‚Äôm too tired to do that. I hope it goes well for you. | Even if that could work for me, I‚Äôm unwilling to put in the effort sorry. I‚Äôd rather just die instead. Only made the original post so I could feel seen for once in my life. | Would if could. Can‚Äôt do it though in my situation. Wouldn‚Äôt even pass so I would have to go the rest of my life being hated. Luckily I won‚Äôt have to go the rest of my life in any way. | Wish I could, can‚Äôt with my home life. Have no friends to stay with. No money to run away with. Depression and gender dysphoria has basically caused me to do nothing in life other than wish I was dead. And now I get that finally üòä | I absolutely agree, adopted kids are just as much your kids as biological ones. Sadly my home life doesn‚Äôt allow me to transition, have no where to run and feel like I messed up my entire life on my own. I was supposed to go on blockers as a teen but let my parents talk me out of it in order to save their mirage after the guilt of attempting suicide. It‚Äôs over for me, I‚Äôve already came to the decision that I‚Äôm going to die now and actually feel some relief knowing I won‚Äôt have to go the rest of my pathetic life being a man. | Sorry. I said that at the time because I was in a state so self hating and depressed I genuinely could not think of a single reason anyone would want to be a man. I‚Äôm sorry. | I‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt. I have almost no will to keep going, the only reason I‚Äôm still alive is that I‚Äôm too tired to even put in the effort to actually kill myself. Even if I dressed in clothes I liked or put on makeup I‚Äôd still be ugly. Outside of gender my entire life has also been awful. I really do hope that you can get better though. | I meant getting pregnant. Also I‚Äôm really worried about long term side effects of HRT if I do go on it. Also I would loose everything, family, friends, job and might go homeless. And even after that might not even pass and just end up feeling like it was all for nothing. | I don‚Äôt want to be born a girl for sex reasons, I don‚Äôt even want to have sex and I‚Äôm never going to regardless. Im going to cut my penis off in order to die in a couple days. I don‚Äôt even want to be an attractive female, I‚Äôd be happy with being an ugly female. I hate being male because I was unlucky enough to be born with gender dysphoria. | I wish I could, but I would loose all my family. I wouldn‚Äôt even pass. | I am an adult already | I would give it a shot but I‚Äôd have to wait awhile to do that to get out of my current family situation and I just can‚Äôt hold on anymore, I‚Äôm sorry. | That‚Äôs super dangerous and also probably not necessary in my case. Also I don‚Äôt want to transition I want to be biologically female. | Sorry but yea, I don‚Äôt want to wait and I don‚Äôt want to be homeless. | I did give it a shot. I begged my parents to let me transition when I was 14 and 15. Even attempted suicide over it, but in the end that suicide attempt just make my life worse then actually dying. Because of that they made their mind up that I was mentally Ill and wouldn‚Äôt be happy if I transitioned. They were also getting a divorce over arguing about it. So out of guilt I cut my hair and tried to be a man for them so they would be happy of who I was. Puberty hit me really hard, went from the smallest kid my age to a full on man. No chance of passing and full of regret. | I‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs too late for me. I‚Äôll never pass and I would rather die then be a man. I wish I never let my parents guilt me into trying to stop being trans for them. I actually had a shot at passing and living the life I wanted but now I have to die. I‚Äôve already made up my mind, as soon as the last of my stuff is donated I‚Äôm going to do it. | Also I have no way to get HRT because my parents won‚Äôt drive me to the appointments and I was never allowed to get a license, job or even hang out with friends as a teen. And even when I kill myself my mom will cry and blame the mental system for failing me and tell all her friends that she lost her son due to mentally illness. She would rather have a dead son that would allow her to complain about how hard her life is than an alive happy daughter. | My dad straight up told me he wish he didn‚Äôt have kids one time lol. And yea I‚Äôm still alive, I broke down crying and couldn‚Äôt do it. My parents had kids because they wanted children, guess now that I‚Äôm not a kid anymore they don‚Äôt give a shit. They never did any actual parenting, never went on family trips and I‚Äôve never felt love. Even if they say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù it really feels like they just that because of societal pressure to love your family. | I‚Äôd like to be female but I can‚Äôt do that. And as for what name I‚Äôd like I honestly don‚Äôt know, I originally wanted my name to be what my parents were going to name me if I was born a girl but considering they‚Äôd rather me kill myself or suffer for their sake for my entire life, I don‚Äôt know if I would want any connection to them at all. But it doesn‚Äôt really matter in the end, I‚Äôm going to try again tomorrow. | Yes sadly | I can‚Äôt get HRT, my parents forbid me from getting a job or license. I assume they did this in order to control me for some reason. They also said I was too young or hid behind the fact that their was a pandemic. Covid fucked my life up even more than it already was, have next to no friends because of it, wasn‚Äôt even allowed to go to fucking school for three years. | I did but I wish I died. | Still alive‚Ä¶ broke down crying. | Still alive, I couldn‚Äôt do it this time. | I started crying and couldn‚Äôt do it. | Somehow you did. I saw your message right before I closed the app and decided to call some people before doing it which led me to break down crying and not being able to do it today. I don‚Äôt know if I want to thank you because I truly want to die, but you‚Äôre comment did at least make me call people instead of trying right away. | I‚Äôm still fucking here, I broke down and couldn‚Äôt go through with it. I called some family and told them that I loved them, reached out to an old friend that I haven‚Äôt talked to years, and then broken down and start crying like the failure of a human I am. I prayed for forgiveness. Then I told my mom for one last time begging her to let me transition, told her I hated her which I don‚Äôt know if I regret or not. She said I‚Äôll always be a man and transitioning would only make me happy for a little bit. She said she just wouldn‚Äôt allow me to because I‚Äôve had no life experience even though I‚Äôm 18 and have felt this way since I was a kid. I hate myself so fucking much for being a coward, every time I felt it as a kid I should have yelled it to whoever would listen. When I went to transition for the first time I shouldn‚Äôt have let my parents weaponize their divorce and my suicide attempt in order to stop me from getting hormones that would have saved my life now. I wish I just went through with it, but even after that she still wouldn‚Äôt realize that I didn‚Äôt have turn out this way if I got the help I needed as a teen, and the mental help I needed as a kid when I was hurt. I hope I die in my sleep tonight. | I can‚Äôt. They never let me get a job as a teen so I have no money. They didn‚Äôt let me go to the last 3 years of high school so I have no where to run to. And then we moved across the county so I can‚Äôt even visit my other family to feel better. | I can‚Äôt have that food üòÇ | Thanks for the advice and caring but I‚Äôm done trying to improve my life. | Because I chickened our, don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll try again today | What are you talking about? I don‚Äôt have any pictures of myself on the internet? Also I don‚Äôt need to worry about voice, I‚Äôve been practicing sounding like a female my whole life. | The thought of having to live this terrible life for another 60 makes me want to vomit. | Nope. I wouldn‚Äôt ever pass even with HRT. And my parents never let me grow out my hair, even after I begged to have long hair since being a child, my mom forced me to buzz it all the time. | Even if I did I would never stop thinking about what if I actually fought for my life as a teen. I can‚Äôt pass now and I don‚Äôt want to live in a world where everyone hates me.

If you wasn't born in a rich family and your parents don't know right people, you'll never have free time to spend on yourself and your hobbies.

u/Hellosadimded,105,"To my girls, dads sorry... I'm sitting here feeling like shit. Knowing that my actions will devastate my older daughter.

Two times has she now unknowingly saved my life, this little wonderful soul.

First was when she was 15 months old.
I would always feed her at night. And change her diaper. 

Normally she would just take the bottle and chug it, holding it herself. While I changed her diaper. Then go back to sleep. This night I had 8-10 beers, was gonna wrap my car around a tree.

As I'm getting dressed sneaking out in the night, I hear her fuzzing. So I make a bottle. When I bring it to her, she drops it and just waits for me to change her. Thinking maybe she wasn't hungry and only needed the diaper changed I take the bottle and open the door to leave.

She then whisper her word for bottle. So I hand it to her again, she drops it. And says her word for bottle again, so I hold the bottle (she always wanted to hold it herself) and she grabbed my thumb with her little hand, and just held it. Even after the bottle was empty, and wouldn't let go until she fell back asleep.

I took that as a sign that even if I feel worse than bad someone needed me...
I sat up that whole night crying, determined to do everything I could to make a change.

I did nothing worked... 

It's now 7 years later. And I have my two daughters every other week.

Everything is worse, more physical/mental ailments. Economy is borderline eviction...

My daughter calls me as I'm setting up for another attempt while they are at their mother's house. And says she got a bad feeling, she worried about me because I used always be happy for xmas. But not this year. 15-30m before I was gonna go through with it. (Guess I couldn't hide it)

She can't/shouldn't have to save me thrice... 

I have made videos for them wishing them happy birthday/xmas/new years. 
For the next 15 years.

And a longer one, where I explain. That they couldn't have done anything different. That they were perfect just the way they are. But dad was broken for too long. ( On USB stick that I hid in my ex house when I dropped of the kids last, she will determine when that video is ok to watch. If ever...)

I'm so sorry... That I won't see you again.
I'm so sorry that we won't laugh together again.
I'm sorry I won't be here for the good and the bad as you two grow up.
I'm sorry that this was the last Christmas we spent together...
I'm sorry I couldn't get better... 

You are the joy of my life, dad loves you more than there are stars in the sky. 
And you both shine like stars. 

Dad tried, I really, really did... For 9 years
I wish I could feel another way, and stay...
But dad has to go away... 

I will love you forever and ever. To the moon and back...




UPDATE: I woke up this morning, and after reading all of your comments I'm overwhelmed. Thank you for the kind uplifting words. 

The biggest reason I have to convince myself into staying. Is the high potential of passing on the mental issues onto them. As one person mentioned. It's made me scrap plans before. That's why I have hung on as long. 

One part of me just wants to make it look like a winter driving accident. 

I do feel guilt, and not being good enough. Things that used to be easy. Now feel like climbing mountains. I do feel useless. 

And I've made myself completely isolated over the years not to burden those around me. Stupid I know, but never having energy to visit or chat with anyone made it to exhausting. And the relationships being totally one-sided brought on another level of anxiety. 

Seeing my daughters faces as I drop them off, and pick them up at kindergarten/school. Hurts me deeply, because I'm counting down the days we have left. And it's not fair to them, I know that.

My older daughter asking if we can do certain things the week after next have me almost breaking down infront of them, because I don't plan on being here then. And I feel absolutely horrible, knowing that the week will never come.

I'm considering staying. Not to implode their lives. Hopefully I deteriorate fast, and I won't be my choice.

They do deserve that much, when you become a parent nothing is about you anymore.
I do love every second we spend together...

u/Historical_Ocelot172,520,"I understand why people commit suicide Hear me out. 

I can understand why people commit suicide. And I think it‚Äôs selfish for loved ones of those who did commit to call them selfish for ‚Äúleaving them‚Äù. No. 

A person suffering from severe mental health conditions that cause them to be suicidal - they can do all the work to get better. They can go to therapy, they can take their medication, they can go to the gym and eat healthy, they can work and save money, they can be social and see their friends and family every other day, they can study for a degree they really want‚Ä¶ but once those feelings of depression, and loneliness and isolation and emptiness come back for them, it‚Äôs so easy to forget the good things you have in your life (I.e. a loving family, a good job, a good gym routine, whatever it is).

But to expect your loved one who has committed suicide to continue living in this vicious cycle of being well and then unwell (whether it‚Äôs because of trauma, a diagnosed disorder, a chemical imbalance, etc) - THAT is selfish. Because unless they also suffer from mental health issues that cause suicidal thoughts and ideation, they will never understand the severity of their condition. They will never understand why they want to die despite all the good things they have in their life. 

So for someone who has been successful in their suicide attempt, I can totally understand why they did it. Even if it‚Äôs someone who isn‚Äôt doing the work to get better (I.e. no therapy, no meds - just straight rawdogging), I can still understand why they want to die and commit suicide, or why they committed suicide.

I am not at all saying that you should go about committing suicide. I think everyone‚Äôs life is important and can be meaningful despite their mental health issues. HOWEVER, if they do feel this way and do try or do end up killing themselves, I would never call them selfish for it because I understand why they would do, or did what they did.

",u/Historical_Ocelot172,9,"That‚Äôs the sort of vibe I got off people who judge others for committing suicide (or trying to). They see suicidal people as weak. If they think suicidal people are weak, why not do something about it to make them ‚Äústronger‚Äù so they wouldn‚Äôt feel inclined to kill themselves? Why not help them? Instead, they do nothing to help suicidal people and pass judgement about issues they will never understand unless they go through it themselves. And they are one trauma away (whether its physical, psychological‚Ä¶), one chemical imbalance, one development of any mental health issues from also experiencing suicidal tendencies. | Absolutely. They always say think of [this person] and [that person]. But I think they forget about the actual person who is suicidal. Think about how they must be feeling and thinking. I think it‚Äôs selfish to expect suicidal people to continue life when they‚Äôre so immersed in their suffering. And the reason why the call suicidal people selfish is because they just don‚Äôt feel what they feel, think what they think, see the world the way the see the world. I‚Äôve stated previously, despite doing all the work to get better (even if there are people who couldn‚Äôt bring themselves to get better), sometimes all that work is just not enough. 

Another thing I‚Äôd like to add as well. When family or friends say they are always here for you, they can always talk to you about things - they truly mean it. However, at the end of the day all we have is ourselves. And when there are times where we can‚Äôt even HELP ourselves (I.e. getting out of bed, cleaning our depression rooms, etc) - what‚Äôs to think other people are gonna help us if we can‚Äôt even do it ourselves. And that‚Äôs what I mean by people who may not do the work to get better. If they can‚Äôt help themselves, how do we expect others to do it for us? Suicide is the only option in their mind, and that‚Äôs why they do it. That‚Äôs why I understand why the did it, and I will NEVER judge a person for committing or trying suicide. Instead, while I may be sad that they lost their lives to suicide - I would wish nothing but peace for them from now on. They knew what they wanted to do, and they were brave enough to do it. If their end goal in killing themselves was to find peace, then I hope they did get peace. Even if it means going to the extremities of taking their own life. As morbid as it sounds, I think anyone who is truly truly suicidal will understand where I am coming from. In the end, all we want is to feel at peace - if drugs can‚Äôt do it, if therapy can‚Äôt do it, if nothing can do it but finding a way out in suicide then‚Ä¶ üôè | Exactly my point. It‚Äôs a never ending cycle - going through the waves of being well and then unwell. And feeling unwell is enough for me personally to start thinking about suicide all over again. But when I am in a good place (also for a limited time), the suicidal thoughts go away and I even question myself - ‚ÄúWhy was I even thinking about killing myself?‚Äù I am diagnosed with BPD so you can imagine the constant changing of emotions on a daily basis. | You‚Äôre so welcome! It‚Äôs so easy to think that my own thoughts are unrelatable. That no one else is going to understand what I am thinking. That‚Äôs why I decided to post my thoughts I was having last night about this topic. To hear that there are people like you who also think in the same way is so comforting, and that these experiences (our thoughts and feelings) are shared. It‚Äôs a reminder that we are not alone after all ‚ù§Ô∏è | 100% - I think anyone with any mental health illness can understand to a degree what it‚Äôs like to be suicidal. Maybe not to the extent that I‚Äôve described, but even thinking of ways it end it is enough of an understanding as to why people commit suicide. | I 100% agree with what this poster said. It‚Äôs not selfish to commit + people DONT care if you‚Äôre doing well or not, they really just don‚Äôt want to be affected by the loss of their friend or family. It‚Äôs selfish of them to expect someone to continue living who has already been suffering. If a person makes a conscious choice to commit, and they do die - then they have succeeded, and did what they wanted to do. I only hope that they finally feel at peace. | I‚Äôm so sorry to hear about your fathers passing. But I understand what you mean, the more older we get, the more we understand about these heavy topics. And you are right in saying that they believe they‚Äôre a burden. I have been called that by own mother, LITERALLY! So they can try and convince us that we aren‚Äôt a burden, our lives matter. And IT IS TRUE, our lives do matter. But when you‚Äôre stuck in this way of thinking and feeling BECAUSE of your mental health condition, or trauma that correlates to suicide - it‚Äôs so easy to remain blind to the good things about yourself, and all the good you have in your life. Life is full of ups and downs, light and dark. And with people who do not suffer from the severity of mental health issues - they can still live within these two concepts of good and bad. But people with mental health issues can‚Äôt because they‚Äôre so overpowered with their negative feelings and thoughts they feel inclined to commit suicide to remove the pain and live in peace. Like I said, you can do all the work, commit to years of self improvement‚Ä¶  but sometimes it‚Äôs just not enough to live a fulfilling life and stay earthside üåø | Thank you so much!

u/HolidayFloor8670,455,"I'm killing myself because of the size of my penis I'm a 35 y/o male from the UK. I've had two unsuccessful attempts in the past but I feel strongly that I need to try again

I've had two ""intimate"" experiences in my life and they both left me with trauma. My first experience was at 16 and my last experience was when I was 22.

The first one was during the only relationship I ever had. We were both 16 and she really wanted us to share our first time together, but she lost interest in me when she saw me naked. She then cheated on me and told all her friends about me, before dumping me.

It took me a long time to get over that and at 22 I went on a date with a woman in her late 30s. The date went really well and she invited me back to hers, but when she saw my penis she said ""that's a little..um..small..."" at which point I froze for a minute and then left

I haven't tried to meet anyone after that and I'm terrified at the prospect of dating & I have a phobia of intimacy that I'll likely never get over. I can't face being humiliated again.  On social media it's ""small dick energy"" this and ""big dick energy"" that.. I'm constantly reminded that I'm a low value person because of my body and I can't live this way.

 I try to carry on and live my empty life the best I can, but I can't take the loneliness anymore. I'm done living with the shame of being such an abomination. I need to go.",u/HolidayFloor8670,150,"I appreciate your reply. I think porn has had an affect on both genders' view on penis size

  
Its nice to know there are other ways of making a woman feel good but in my experiences, I was mocked/rejected before it even got to that

I know I'll probably have tobe up front about it if I were to date in the future, but the thought of bringing it up feels rreally daunting. I dont know of any other body defect that would require having to tell people about it first

An asexual relationship would probably make the most sense for me, as I genuinely don't feel I'd be able to be intimate with anyone again | Just over 5 inches but terrible girth | Just over 5 inches but terrible girth | Thank you for your encouragement. It might be a filter but it comes with a lot of shame and humiliation if she decides to mock me. I do agree though that I wouldnt want to be in a relationship with someone who sees me that way anyway

I appreciate your explanation a lot. Unfortunately, I find it really difficult to meet people and I cant even think about intimacy without feeling scared. I don't know how likely it is that I'll meet someone who either doesn't care, or at least is more gentle about her feelings | I wish I could believe this, but the fact that small penis jokes are probably the most common makes me think that most women care about size | I'm frightened of even trying to date women, the thought of trying to be intimate again is so terrifying I can't even comprehend it. When it got down to the moment in the past I ended up being humiliated each time | Thank you. As another woman said tho, being 35 with no experience is a turnoff for women :( | Thank you :) I cant imagine the thought of anyone being sad to leave me, especially involving anything intimate | What's that? | If they're not the norm, why are penis size jokes so common | Thank you for your kind words. I hope I can find my community üôè | Maybe I might have been worth something back then but today I'm pond scum. | Thank you for your reply. I just feel its too late for me now. I'm 35 with no experience and I have a fest of trying again. I'm no catch for anyone | Thanks. Unfortunately I was made to feel that it does define me | I never had the opportunity to learn or practice anything like that. I just get rejected as soon as a woman sees it. | First off, you're not rude at all. You come across as very caring. 

I do find it tough to believe that many women out there wouldnt be put off by me, but maybe I've just been exposed to the wrong people. Your explanation of social media makes a lot of sense

  
As for meeting people irl... I honestly don't. I go to concerts sometimes but I'm always alone. I do have hobbies and stuff but I've never gone to a convention as I never have anyone to go with | I'm really sorry about your experiences. Some people really are evil. I'd call the jacking off to other girls thing an evil act. You did so well to rise above that.

I think in the past I was TOO trusting and now I've gone to the other extreme where I don't trust anyone to see my body and not shame me. I know there's a middle ground between the two that is probably the healthier mindset | Thank you :) | I wish it was possible for me to meet someone like you | Thanks for your reply. In the past I've deleted women from my social media for sharing small dick jokes/memes or for using terms like small/big dick energy. I don't want that kind of toxicity around me | Considering how I've been treated I find it difficult to believe that women don't care about size. I've never experienced this compassion you talk of either

I think I'm too far gone now. I doubt I'll ever truly be able to enjoy intimacy, if I ever got the chance again. Too much self doubt | Thanks, I appreciate your reply. I know a lot of women here are saying the size doesn't matter but I find it quite hard to believe, considering what happened to me and also how society views smaller ones.

I've never seen someone use big/small dick energy to describe a woman. I've only seen it used at men. If people just mean confidence why don't they just say that? Small dick energy is body shaming language, its saying that big = good and small = bad. To protect my own mental health I've actually deleted women who use that term, or share small dick jokes, from my social media

I've never heard of women who like inexperienced guys. I was under the impression that was a major turnoff

I do appreciate the advice I've been given but I still think a romantic relationship without sex would  be my ideal. | Hey. Do you think an asexual woman would be okay with dating a heterosexual guy who doesn't want sex? | You sound lovely and I'm sorry your next experiences made you anxious. Was it something they said or did that made you feel that way? I'm just wondering because you didn't have that phobia with your first partner

What are your main concerns? I don't wish to belittle you in anyway but I'm sure lots of guys would love to help you through what you're going through 

Thanks for reaching out, please love yourself | Thanks mate | I wish I could disagree with you but those are all my fears. I dont think anyone would be faithful to me | I appreciate your comment but I don't think penis size can compare with breast size. I've been made to feel like no one could ever possibly enjoy being intimate with me. I can't see a way out and I see no worth in continuing | Moving away from the UK might be my only chance | Why? | Well the first girl I was in a relationship with. We were very young tho so maybe it'll be different now. I just feel my lack of experience at 35, as well as my fears of trying again, don't make me a good catch | I wish I could believe you fully, but I can't help but feel like the vast majority of women would be disappointed with a smaller one. As I've said in other replies, the prominence of the penis size jokes makes me think that size is very important | They acted like I chose it or something | I think it's over for me too | I think I've given up on ever being intimate again. Hopefully I can find a relationship without sex | The first experience was in a relationship. We both wanted to have our first time together until she saw me naked. I've never even used a dating app. I don't like the idea of a one night stand | how would i even know who wouldn't hate it? | all opinions matter bro. thanks for sharing yours. this is actually the first tie if ever heard of a guy being turned down by a woman for being too big

  
ive always been open in my head to trying toys and starpons etc, but since I got rejected and laughed at as soon as they see it, i never had the chance | I hear what you're saying but I can't imagine I'll ever be comfortable with intimacy again | Thanks, that is encouraging. I only put so much weight on my size because of how prevalent the small penis jokes are, as well as my experiences of course | I'm.a gamer but I mostly play older games.

I appreciate what you're saying but I think any woman would be secretly disappointed with what I have | I've never even had sex; I got rejected before it got to that. I also wish it was as easy as you make out, but trauma is more complicated than ""get over yourself."" | I didn't put my self worth on my sexual value per se. I just stopped trying to meet women & consequently I'm terribly lonely. At any rate I feel society/my experiences have made it clear that guys like me ARE of low value. | I'm 35, basically middle aged, I can't see it getting any better now. I wish I could believe that most women wouldn't care but small penis jokes exist for a reason. I'd be more than happy to try oral but in my previous experiences it didn't even get to that stage. I don't know how I can practice that without a partner | I've never had sex. I got humiliated before I had the opportunity | Also are you suggesting I'm not worthy of a monogamous relationship? All you've done is make me more scared | I never use reddit and don't watch porn | Thanks for your comment. I'm becoming more aware that women would be okay with oral and toys. I'd even be ok with wearing a strapon if I wasn't big enough for her. The problem is that I'm really scared of meeting people now. I don't know how I'd find the right woman | Not just mens. I mean, it wasn't ME who reacted badly to.my penis. Especially with the first girl, I.think she had expectations from porn that I could never live up to | It's quite confusing because other people here are saying I need to tell them about it before, if not she'll feel angry or that they feel I was dishonest

It's not easy to know between who would tolerate it and who would humiliate me | In all honesty I think I'm better off just avoiding sex. I think all women secretly prefer guys on the bigger side. I can never live up to that, I can only offer disappointment. | Wow ok | It's a 100% humiliation rate | What am I supposed to do with sex toys on my own? 

I wish I believed love was more important but my experiences made me realise that size is very important 

& no would know. Even in death I'd be too ashamed to mention my size | Make who cum twice? I can't even meet anyone lol

And if people mean confidence why don't they just say that? It's body shaming language. It's saying big = good and small = bad | im not sure if you're mocking me or not. | please don't simplify the issue. If I've been ruthlessly mocked and humiliated I wouldn't be in the frame of mind to try anything like that | No.matter how you want to dress it up, when you're saying small or big dick energy, you're saying that big = good and small = bad. It's body shaming language and it's abhorrent. It will always be a body shaming term.

Just say :""confidence"" ffs.

How do you think terms like that make people feel? | I didn't know this. Thanks. Again though I don't know how to go about meeting people so idk how likely it will be to meet someone like that | I think the experience when I was 16 was due to this.. she was expecting what she saw in porn and I could never live up to those expectations | I've never actually used a dating app | I wish I could believe otherwise but I think you're probably in the minority there. Small penis jokes are some of the most common, I think most people would be disgusted by me | ikr | I was thinking the same thing | That's probably because guys who are 5 and under are too scared to date. So thr ""average"" becomes the average of the active dating pool | I can't get good at oral or practice it when I'm too scared to meet anyone | Thank you for replying. I appreciate your empathy  :) | Sorry for the deletion. Wrong account

I appreciate you and thank you for your empathy. It is incredibly daunting to even consider being naked with someone 

A romantic, asexual relationship might be ideal | probably not much thicker than my thumb | Thank you. I'm glad you see it as being vulnerable too. its definitely daunting to think of putting myself out there again | thank you, an earlier comment telling me to just get over myself bothered me. im glad you can appreciate how traumatic it was | Hmm | I guess I could get on board with that logic. It's the ""small dick energy"" stuff, which is solely from women, that bothers me | I can't see myself being brave enough to try meeting anyone anytime soon. I appreciate your advice tho | thats exactly it.. breaking the ice. if I'm approached I can communicate pretty well but otherwise I'm just a deer in headlights at all times. those glasses are awesome! | Thanks for your input! I do appreciate it. It sounds like you've experienced a lot of what I've been through so I'm glad you found your happy ending | Thank you for that reassurance. Sorry to bother you again but do you know of any communities I can join? | well, only one woman here told me it was my fault. but yes I do find it incredibly tough to disagree with your logic, when ""small dick energy"" etc is the main insult of the day | id be more prepared to choose life if it wasnt so loenly | If we're superior why are we universally mocked | With all due respect, go fuck yourself.

Childish? How is this helpful? 

I've never even had so much as a compliment on my looks before. Something you won't even be able to imagine. Thanks for confirming that I shouldn't be trying. | What makes you think I give off incel vibes? | You've just made me more scared | You seem sweet :) | I've never used a dating app as I have insecurity over the way I look, so being judged on pictures kind of frightens me.

I think I'm leaning more towards the idea of a romantic relationship w/o sex. I think for me that would be ideal. Whether or not that's likely is another question. Partly because the thought of having to let her know my flaw to her, in the hopes she won't hate me/mock me, is almost dehumanising :/ maybe it's not, but to me it feels that way. I'm not quite sure how to explain it | Sorry if I annoyed you. I just think it might take a while before I believe that women don't hate small penises. As I said originally, it's also the jokes etc that many women often say that make me think they'll hate my body | It's OK and thanks for understanding. I don't know whether or not penetration would work as I never got around to that part. I'd be more than okay with trying toys, oral etc but again I didn't get that chance | that's just a cliche. people like me are fair game for ridicule, society & my experiences have made it very clear where I stand in the world | I've always been under the impression that having a small pp meant I don't deserve any fun :( & now the thought of 'fun' terrifies me

  
sorry if my reply was rude, i didnt mean it to be. I'm just very emotional | I didn't take it that way. It tells me you understand my situation | I really hope I could make someone happy, I just have a lot of doubts | I do appreciate your input. It's just that the low probability of meeting someone who wouldn't be put off by it is daunting. I guess there's always bringing it up first but that's daunting as well | Thank you. I just don't know where to go from here really, as far as meeting people goes | I find it hard to believe there are women out there who dream of what I‚Äôve got, but I appreciate your comment. It's not the saying no that scares me per se - it's more the laughing/snickering, comments, and hearing about it from one of her friends weeks  later :/ | Thank you. I appreciate your reply and ideas. I'm really shy and have no confidence so I find it a struggle talking to women irl. I do agree with your idea about getting to know someone on a personal level first, but I even struggle with that part. Sex therapy is definitely an option | I appreciate the effort you put into replying. but with all the stigma around small penises as well as terms like ""small dick energy"" I find it tough to believe that many women would prefer a smaller size. my suicidal thoughts aren't just based on my experiences but also due to how society views ""men"" like me as a whole. I feel like my only realistic chance would be if I mentioned it before it got to that stage, and be prepared to be rejected I guess | I've always been terrified that she wouldn't feel anything or any motion due to my size :/ | Sorry for the deletion. I posted on the wrong account. 

I'd never lie about my size but the way you explained it made it sound like you were really angry at him over his size. I'm sure you tried to help but you've just reminded me how terrifying it would be. I'm better off not trying. I don't want to make a woman angry or upset because of my body. I'm better off not trying | I'm 6 foot exactly. Maybe sex therapy will help | Thank you. It feels like it's the end of the world in all honesty | Slightly overweight I'd say | if it's never about the penis size, then why did my experiences happen? why are small penis jokes so popular? 

I would have liked to get good at using other body parts but I've never been granted the opportunity. | I appreciate this. Thank you | Awesome! I'm just hoping I'd be welcome there even though I'm not asexual | I really appreciate your positive outlook. I've always thought someone like me could never be boyfriend material

I know I'm not ready to meet anyone yet. If I do decide against killing myself I'm going to need more therapy to address the trauma | I'm so sorry to hear that. Totally understandable why that might be overwhelming 

In all honesty the thought of penetration is very overwhelming for me as well. I'd he more than happy to be in a relationship without penetrative sex | thank you :) | I've never heard anything like that last sentance before. thank you :') | I appreciate what you were saying. Nothing you said was offensive, you were very thoughtful | Dw I've dumped my fair share of therapidts | I think the first girl definitely was. Porn gave her expectations that I could never live up to. | Again, I've never been given that opportunity. I get huniliated before it gets to that. :( | sorry if my reply was dismissive, im just feeling rather hopeless. I want to believe you about size not mattering, i guess i wont have a different opinion on that unless i have a positive experience, idk. i still feel its going to be tough to meet someone | Thank you | You're so kind. Your positive attitude has made me smile :) it's really unfortunate that my first experiences weren't with someone like you.

He tells me he is broken and can‚Äôt be fixed, that his parents f*cked him up so badly and that he is convinced this damage is permanent. He isolates himself and refuses to open himself up to others.

Personally I both want to die as well as getting help. But getting help would also mean that other people would find out as well as a likely stay at grippy-sock jail. Because of some things that happened, I have trauma regarding asking for help and last time I was asked a more personal question I freaked out and laughed like I was going crazy until the conversation was over. And just asking for help without my parents knowledge would be deeply shameful and I‚Äôm unsure if I could stand myself after that.

I  am actually quite happy I could get here without asking for help since help would be such a horrible experience for me. I would become weak to myself and forever stuck weak to my parents and friends. It would be a social suicide which would damage my reputation and pride so much I would just use a gun next time. I don‚Äôt want to live and asking for help would be such an embarrassment that it would be much worse than just dying by it‚Äôs own. There‚Äôs not supposed to be shame in help. But I definitely experience it, so doesn‚Äôt it exist in that case? | Yes but I should be able to fix this on my own | I can‚Äôt. Killing myself would be easier and a more respectable way to go | Yes I know what I am going to say does not align with most people moral compass but I think suffering in silence and deciding for yourself that it‚Äôs better to just die the force your problems on others.

They can‚Äôt hold down schooling or a career which is a horrible thing because you need money. They can‚Äôt imagine themselves doing anything or their life going anywhere. I‚Äôll end up rotting away at this rate. I feel like it‚Äôs a mistake me being here and I have to correct that mistake. 

Edit: I didn‚Äôt really expect this to blow up. Some backstory, I‚Äôm from Southeast Asia. Not a Chinese spy.. as some have put it. So the Asian pressure is there, I guess.

All I feel is jealousy and self hatred and fear. I don‚Äôt care about getting help. It‚Äôs embarrassing. Being an only child and having all this money invested into me only to turn out like this.. and on top of that, having to spend money on medicine and a therapist because I came out of the womb a fucked up failure?

u/KitsuneCreativ,279,"Please help me. This is urgent, I need advice quickly. I am going to lose him. I'm shaking while typing this. My friend, who has previously been very open about being suicidal and has been worsening throughout the past couple months, stating he'd commit suicide within the year, joined a voice chat I was having with another friend, and said that he almost died without elaborating. Then, a couple minutes later, he started randomly repeating an exact date, time and location. February 3rd, 10pm, along with a location I will not say. I tried finding this on Google maps to see how close it was to his house. After a bit, he sent me and my friend a link to Google maps street view. It was the location he stated, a view of being on a bridge with train tracks beneath it. The hint was obvious. On Saturday, my friend is going to try to kill himself. Please, reddit, what should I do?

Edit: I have spoken to my parents and will speak to a school Councillor tomorrow, and take it from there. If I don't update this, I either forgot to edit or didn't manage to save him.

Edit 2: Thanks for the advice, I know what to do already. You don't need to leave any more comments.

Edit 3: Im making this edit to tell you guys you don't need to be concerned for him and that he'll be fine. His mother is aware, not his father for personal reasons to him. His mum is keeping an eye on him and now he has no possible way to get there since it's far away. Thank you guys, I think you've all helped save a life.

Edit 4: February 3rd, 11:03 and he's still alive and at home. He's safe. I did it. Thank you guys so much. I love every single one of you who helped me and him. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all.

Hey guys. Writing this the day after. He attempted suicide. He did this around midnight last night. He sent a message and ten minutes later I saw it and quickly got my parents to call his mum. I think that was the only reason his mother was able to wake up in time and stop him. If I hadn't checked my phone last night because I was bored, I probably would have lost my best friend.

I always wake my son up in the mornings, he's not a morning person and hadn't woke up yet, so I went to get him up for breakfast. He's diabetic and has done good at maintaining it for some time now.

This morning about 7-8ish, as I was trying to get him up, I couldn't keep myself from crying. I'd pulled the blanket down a bit and there were nothing but insulin syringes. All of them were used. He would not wake up. I had my husband call an ambulance while I was trying to get him out of bed, it was obvious enough that he was trying to commit suicide. He's fully aware what can happen if he does this, and he's struggled with his mental health for years. I feel like a bad parent for not seeing any signs, for not noticing how bad it was getting for him. I feel like I don't deserve a child if I can't keep this from happening, if I can't keep them happy to begin with.

By the time the ambulance got there I already started to give in and just break down more, they took off with him and my husband and I followed to the hospital, we waited for him to be settled in so we could go see him, it's been hours, we just got in and he's barely alive. He took a ton of pills on top of all the insulin, and now he's in a coma. He's on a lot of machines and fluids, it's scary and I don't want to see him like this. I owe him a million apologies for not seeing how badly he needed help, I feel like a god awful parent. I don't know how I didn't notice, I don't know how long he'd been laying there, I don't know where he even got the pills and I don't know how he got into the insulin. Because of his struggles with his mental health we've always kept those things locked up or hidden, all medications, everything he might be able to hurt himself with. He's been off his meds for months, he was doing better without them I thought, but clearly he wasn't. I feel bad. I don't know how I could let this happen. I was scared he wouldn't pull through, and later to find out he didn't. Of course there was a stash. Of course there was. I know I should've stayed positive but I don't know how. My husband doesn't want to talk about it and I don't know where else or who else I can talk to. I feel worse for making a post about this, even worse for making it about how I feel when clearly he's in more pain and needs to be able to handle it. I'm scared. I'm truly scared. I have no idea how to handle this. One day he's at his peak and doing amazing and the next he's laid up in the hospital, barely holding on. I don't know what to think, I feel like it's my fault this happened. I'm sorry for doing this here but I don't have anywhere else to go with this. It feels like my fault, is it? Is there even a chance that I did something wrong or that I drove him to this point? I don't want to lose him.

I've tried to talk to him, I've taken him to therapy, a psychiatrist, I've done everything I can to help, I know he won't tell me everything, I hate it but there's nothing I can really do about it, I've voided my own emotions for a while so I can focus on him, he's still not awake, I can't do much else than sit here with him.

Thank you for this, and I'll keep these recommendations incase he wants something else instead of the omnipod, thank you so much | Thank you.

u/LifeIsJustASickJoke,335,"""Only cowards would kill themselves."", ""Selfish."", ""No real man would do that."" It‚Äôs amazing how closed-minded someone can be. I simply don't understand society's attitude. Many say things like ""Selfish,"" ""Coward,"" ""No real man would do that,"" etc. Do people even understand what they are saying?

Think about it: if someone takes their own life and commits suicide, that person goes against all natural instincts to stay alive. And then people dare to call that person a coward?

No, the real cowards are the ones who think it's selfish for someone to kill themselves and accuse those who do of being cowards.

Most people don't even care if you're doing well; they just don't want you to commit suicide because it would negatively affect their lives. In other words, they would rather see you live a life full of suffering because they don't want to deal with your suicide, and that is the real selfishness.",u/LifeIsJustASickJoke,2,"Thank you for your kind words, I appreciate that | Same, lol (my dad) he made jokes about it... | Couldn't have said it better. | Thank you.

u/Lifted06Titan,140,"Wife of 20 years & partner for 33 says she wants to divorce Well here I am in a place I never thought I'd be in a million years. (just like many of you)  As the title says I've been with my one and only wife for 33 years now and 2 days after Valentine's day she tells me she's been unhappy for about as long as we've been married.  It was like I entered some altered universe at that second.  I'm almost speechless just trying to process what she said, and then she says we're over, let's get divorced.  No warning of ""hey, let's talk, or hey, this is bothering me"".... nothing.  I asked where all this is coming from and if she's feeling this way we should try whatever it takes to save our marriage.  She told me she's done with being married and that she wants to focus on herself at this point. We have 2 great kids, a nice house in a safe neighborhood, and some awesome pets.  Kids are happy, do great in school, and never wanted for much that we couldn't provide.  In fact, our house has always been a happy place, pretty much homebase for all their friends when hanging out.  We've been together since meeting in high school and have rarely gotten into any arguements over the course of all these years.  Friends have even commented on how we have it so good and are so lucky we don't have to deal with all the typical, immature BS bickering that comes with being a couple.  We are still living in the same house together and for the most part are pretending that she didn't crush me by unloading all this on me, all while we had a movie paused.  It just seems so unfair that she wouldn't enough respect for our marriage to at least bring up whatever is bothering her so we can talk about things, and seems even more unfair when there's 2 kids involved as well.  When I ask questions to try to make sense of any of it she says, ""I don't know what to tell you, or ""I'm just don't feel like I can talk to you.""  I'm like, ""it's me, what do you mean?""  Then she just comes back with the whole, ""I don't know what to tell you, I'm just done.""  Never in my life have I felt this kind of pain and confusion, like I got totally ambushed, and she's typically super sweet and nice all the time so this is just impossible to wrap my head around.  I've been so in love with her since we were 17 and still am to this day.  She's completely perfect to me.  So long story short, I get it now, I get how we end out wanting to end everything when life can throw you the worst curves that beforehand you thought were unimagineable.  I wish life had an easy ejection button, just want to dissappear forever.  Thx for reading",u/Lifted06Titan,1,"Thanks for all the feedback, it's always nice to get different perspectives and hear others experiences.  I wish nobody had experienced anything like this, but here we are.  I'd love to have her get screened for anything medical related but I know even suggesting that anytime soon would turn super defensive, like I'm coming at her with something unrealistic.  The most hurtful part is that all the attitude and coldness is only directed at me....still really nice and cordial to others.  I can deal with things that make sense, but major life changes without a crystal clear reasoning for it is hard to process.  At a fresh 49 it's too soon to be menopause because I would happily deal with that ""expected"" storm because at least then you might have something to base some issues on.  Anyway, thank you all for your comments, I hope the best for everyone because if we weren't dealing with major issues, we would not be in this sub. | Hey I know it's been a week but I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to even comment to me.  Never done the whole Reddit thing but seeing everyone chime in actually feels like I'm not so isolated with my issues | That's really what makes a horrible thing even worse, just to get ambushed with a crap ton of things with no warnings or ""hey, this is really bothering me or could you stop or start doing this for me.""  Just a full blown attack with no emotion.  I agree with you, it's like we're supposed to take it all in, somehow process all of it, and just move on.  For anyone with an ounce of emotion or love in the heart, that is simply an impossible thing to expect of someone | I'd agree with you but she works from home and never really leaves the house.  Weekends when we're off, both of us are home so I can rule that on out.  I think the wiring in some women's (not all, this is not a blanket statement by any means) heads just shift when they hit a certain age and maybe there's an explanation for it, maybe not.  All I know is when I was younger I've seen some major personality shifts with some of my friend's mom's when they were hitting late 40s eary 50's.  Whether that's at play here or not, I honestly couldn't tell you.  I wish you the best of luck if you're dealing with anything similar, it sucks | Right there with you, some of the things we are dealt are just too much to deal with.  Shit hits so much harder when it actually comes from the person who you love the most in the whole world, aka the person who should have your back through thick and thin.  I wouldn't want to cause someone an ounce of this kind of pain, it's amazing how fast your life can get flipped when the person you were planning on getting old with, is the one who decided to create the chaos and heartbreak.

u/ManicPixieNightmarex,173,"I don‚Äôt understand how other people have a will to live (24F) I hate working. I hate my job, I‚Äôve hated every job I‚Äôve had.

And I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones, I GET to have a job in an office that isn‚Äôt physically laborious. And yet I feel bored, miserable, worthless. My work is a constant reminder of how meaningless my life is.

All my free time I spend rotting away on my phone, consuming garbage content and advertisements. I spend all my money on dumb shit. I constantly waste all of my own time and money, I‚Äôm not in control of myself at all. Of course I‚Äôm ‚Äúworking on it‚Äù but nothing has changed in years, I‚Äôve always been like this. Just prone to wasting my time, attention, and money on worthless shit. I hate myself for it.

Obviously have given up on love. I have such a burning hatred in my heart for men that I would actually rather kill myself than devote my life to a piece of shit man. 

Dating men has been the most disappointing, pleasureless, draining experience of my life. My dating pool is full of porn addicted, video game addicted losers, that are more interested in fucking randos off of dating apps than committing to one person. 

My last bf settled on me because he was not ‚Äúin demand‚Äù enough to have sex with different women, not because he was actually in love with me. I was just the only and easiest woman willing to fuck him. 
He enlightened me to the truth that is, if a man could, he would rather fuck many different women for the rest of his life than be with one woman. But, most of them can‚Äôt, so they settle. 

I don‚Äôt want to be second choice to porn and dating apps. I don‚Äôt want to be stuck with some mid guy with no options who settles for me unenthusiastically just to get his pathetic dick wet and have the social status of having a partner. 

But I also don‚Äôt want to just have casual sex with guys cuz most guys are genuinely terrible in bed and I don‚Äôt develop attraction fast enough to have casual sex anymore. 

I just don‚Äôt get where people find the motivation to stay in jobs for their whole lives. A  partner isn‚Äôt motivating to me

I‚Äôm not trying to attack you personally, but a lot of guys aren‚Äôt honest with themselves about what they truly want.

And sure, not all men are like that, but I‚Äôd rather die alone than RISK being with a man just for him to ending up dumping me or cheating on me. They always lie at the beginning and pretend to be better than who they are.

u/Manrieso,311,"My psychologist told me that now I am useless  Honestly, the topic is long and rambling, so I will make a simple summary:

(19M) I spent my entire life with the idea that I have a small dick, although I was not that angry with the fact, I found a group that showed me how I could grow my penis.

I don't blame them, but I ended up injuring myself, these last 3 months that I have been injured I literally have a lot of bad symptoms (if you want to read them literally it is my previous post)

But the important ones are, partial ED and pain.

I went from doctor to doctor, some denied what they had, others simply gave me sleeping pills and that's it.

Although my head obviously has not been in the best place, it was moderately stable, my last doctor recommended a ""psychologist specialized in these injuries"" so that I could talk about it. 

I decided to give it a try to see what it was like.

The first time I was in session with her everything went fairly well I guess, the problems passed in the last (second) session.

I don't remember what I was talking about because I ended the sentence with ""life can suck my dick."" 

She just looked at me and said ""Well, that doesn't mean much if you're almost useless at it now, does it?""

I just remember staying silent, I really think it was the first time I felt something so raw in my chest, she had to have noticed my face and apologized instantly.

Since then I really fell to a new low, I guess that's how I look to others now.

I don't think I'm suicidal, it always seemed stupid to me or I saw it as a permanent solution to a momentary problem, but this is not momentary.

And if even a damn psychologist sees me as something useless, I don't even know what to think.
",u/Manrieso,64,"Thanks, I know it wasn't professional at all, but I want to think that she said it from the point of view that now I just have to think about moving forward. | Yeah, now I don't take it so seriously, although these days I do get to drill my head quite deep, although I worry that she is an ""injury specialist"" on a psychological level It must be hell to spend many sessions with her. | I could do it, but she is friends with the doctor who recommended her to me, so I guess my best option is to wait a little. | Hey Man, Yeah I've been doing pelvic stretches for this, although unfortunately I haven't seen much improvement | Yeah, the remaining 20 minutes of the session after that comment were awkward. | I don't know, it's been a long 3 months and it's only getting worse, but well I guess the last thing would be an implant | She is friends with the doctor who recommended her to me, in my opinion my best option is to wait a little. | Ohhh yes ""tough love"", I had a friend who suffered from that with his partner, that always seemed so stupid to me, let's see to a certain point I understand the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã""pushing"" a person a little harder so they can improve, but if we move that to simply exploiting fears and insecurities, hoping that the person decides to change them instead of simply giving in to depression, it is Russian roulette with 5 bullets.

Thanks for the kind words! | I still don't want to classify her as a psychological shovel, maybe she just had a big bad slip.

And yes, since the beginning of my adolescence I had the idea that if I can't be a 10 in üçÜ, I can try to be a 10 in everything else. | I have to think about it, I don't know if what I want or need is to simply change psychologists, even with all the recommendations this woman had. | If I'm honest, it's a joke that I could make without a problem, although I would have waited a couple of sessions, everything too fresh not to expect to come out stained. | Yes, I suppose there is something for everyone and I try that, even with this injury and how annoying it is, I try to be and be better day by day. | I understand what you mean, but there is a big difference between ""not wanting to do something"" and ""not being able to do something"", but besides that, my injury has other complications, if I do not have good blood flow I can suffer atrophy, or even necrosis (extreme case but never out of the question). 

Not to mention that now the problem in addition to the ED is the pain I have. | In my case it was always easier for me to be with female specialists, although for obvious reasons I have my exceptions. | Sorry I guess, I just wanted to talk about how this psychologist made me feel useless, but ok | You're right about her, she doesn't know how different people could take such a ""crude"" comment perhaps? But I want to give it one more chance.

I am a person with dark humor so although that comment obviously affected me because of how crude and ""excessive"" it was, I don't want to ruin her work or her life for something that perhaps she didn't mean, after all, we can all make mistakes. | Yeah dude, Although thank God I wasn't doing jelqing, this injury is quite annoying, but I think I can take a little of both, you know? A couple of recovery tips from these forums and doctors.

Almost no media or urologist recognized or recommended pelvic stretches and that is what has been helping me to a certain extent, that was taken directly from the same forums.

I just hope that my urologist takes it more seriously, because the excuse of ""you're 19, such serious or permanent damage is impossible"" is no longer useful to him. | Hey, thanks for the kind words, but I'm really not that amazing, these 3 months have been hard and my family has had the worst part

Just to understand it a little better, this injury acts with the body's sympathetic nerve, while stressed, the symptoms and pain worsen, this ended up overloading my head for ""nerve overstimulation"", This caused/causes radical changes, whether from happy to sad or angry, etc. So my family had to endure the first month of those sudden changes in my character, plus obviously the symptoms, the pain, etc

I already went to a clinician and 2 urologists, I had 3 different tests that in the end they only confirmed what I told them I had but they didn't want to listen to me and they still don't want to do it.

And about the ""great"" psychologist, it's not my first time with someone like that, although this time it was more of ""sitting with a lump in my throat and enduring the last 20 minutes"" I want to know what she thinks, I really like to think that no matter what happens I won't lose in the conversation, as long as I don't get up and walk away. | Yeah, You are right about that, although as the opposite sex we can see the insecurities from another point of view.

Think about it this way, I know many girls who are bothered by having varicose veins or stretch marks even when they are young, they say ugly or worse things to each other because of it.

I don't know any man who has ever said anything about that to a woman, 99% of us don't care or even give it importance to see it.

And I think the point of view of the opposite sex is useful to see that some things are not the end of the world.

An extreme example would be breast cancer, many feel horrible, disfigured or worse...

But I think that if they talked about it with more men, they would realize that they are still beautiful and that there is no need to denigrate themselves for that. | To be honest he is somewhat right, I am not in a ""suicidal"" state, although I am not in a state that I want to live either, I'm in the middle, I'm tired, in the last 3 months I only sleep 3-4 hours a day and without that I feel like I didn't sleep.

The only thing that keeps me stable is knowing that I don't want to leave my family like this and everything I learned by helping a friend who was really worse than me (he was actually suicidal, (he mixed pills with alcohol, high doses of antidepressants, cuts, blah blah blah) I spent a lot of time with him until he ended up slowly resuming his life.

But to be really honest, being 19 and probably losing my penis I think is reason enough to become depressed at the very least. | Good point, but from my point of view with this injury, I really wanted to see the opposite sex's point of view, although her comment was literally ""more than I can chew"" but oh well. | Thank you, it seemed a little difficult or embarrassing to talk about it like that, but I think it's for the best, it's better to let it out before it explodes inside, you know? | Hi, If I'm honest, quite a bit worse, although I guess I need to keep kicking",1axiw15,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1axiw15/my_psychologist_told_me_that_now_i_am_useless/,-0.9982144832611084,-0.9854720234870911,0.012742459774017334,neutral

u/Medium_Rest3537,152,"I'm so depressed that my reasons for suicide are becoming more logical instead of irrational. It's like I keep coming up with reasons that it's more logical to kill myself than stay alive. 

1. Why be an emotionless husk when I could potentially reincarnate into a happier life?

2. My circumstances are the reasons for my depression, but there are only so many externally forces you can actually control.

3. If the afterlife and god exists, that makes my life pointless because I'm just going to reincarnate into some worthless fag in the next round. And I hate people who AREN'T me.

4. If there is no god or afterlife, then I'm embarrassed that I'm this shit-slinging ape-type life form instead  of something with enhanced intelligence and invulnerability.

5. I cannot use fiction as an escape anymore because it makes me feel like those worlds are real and I could go to them if I offed myself.

6. People who circlejerk how beautiful life is, funnily enough, make me want to kill myself even more because of its absurdity. They don't actually believe that, they're just under the influence of simple caffeine.

7. If the all loving source is real and it feels better than being alive...well idk guys. I thought spirituality was suppose to make me want to live, not convince me to go.

I've been reading through articles and they says if you went 48 hours you might survive. I didn't drink much just a really really tiny amount cuz I was too much of a pussy and that burning sensation stopped me.
Considering drinking more so I can die. At least in coma, if it didn't have enough acetone for me to die.
I'm getting nausea but I can't tell if it's from something else and anxiety like always or the acetone poisoning.
It's been 48 hours so I don't have much hope that it was that. I accidentally drank it as a child and still survived.. maybe I should  find a better way
The only thing giving me hope is the word MIGHT the fact that I **might** survive after 48 hours.

I (20M) graduated high school in 2020. I have been trying to apply for universities around the world to escape the shithole I am living in.

I'll be going to a pretty good university in the middle east.

u/NL426,100,"Only one way out... I've been thinking of suicide for a few years now (41m). Divorced in 2019, lost everything. The outlook for the future is bleek. Dead end jobs, no college education. Good at some things,but master of nothing when it comes to making money and employment. 

I come from poverty. My first childhood home didn't have running water. Raised on a tiny aboriginal community in Manitoba. Work ethic was instilled in me early on. That's prettymuch all I have to offer. 

I moved to the closest city at 18. Got a good job, and  learned how to support myself. Met my ex wife a couple of years later. We got pregnant young, too young. We struggled but we we're making it happen. Bought a house, moved into a better job. Got pregnant again. Everything seemed and felt as it should. 

As time went on, like any young couple we ran into problems. Problems that we're never dealt with properly. As the years went on, those problems started to fester and creep their way into our lives. I left my plant job to pursue my dream in a trade. That was a mistake. I took a huge paycut in doing so. At the same time she was doing her studies online and earning a degree. I bounced from job to job looking to get back to making more money,  while her career took off in social work. 

Once she got her masters, she was making enough money to support herself and the kids. In 2019, we got divorced. I was not in a good position for this. I had been working on the road and was laid off. When I got back I was out of the house 2 weeks later. No job, limited in funds. In less than 2 months she had someone else moved in. A rich banker. His office in the bank and her office for social work were literally 50 yards apart. 

We lived in the same town for a couple years of 13000 people. It was hard for me seeing my family around town with him. That's were the initial suicidal thought really started. 

They then moved to BC, the most expensive place in Canada in 2022. To be honest, when we were still together that was the plan for us to move there. Either way she got what she wanted. 

With that, I never saw my sons for an entire year. People have said I shouldn't have let her get away with that, but my sons wanted out of Portage. I didn't want to hold them back. I saved up for a year, sold things off and moved to BC in April 2023. I found a decent job and lived in my car for a couple of months till I got a summer rental. But I didn't care, I was close to my sons and that's all that mattered. As long as I found a permanent place before winter. In the okanogan that's easier said than done. I didn't find a place and ended up having to move 9 hours away to Edmonton to live with my brother. It was only supposed to be for the winter. That brings me to the present. Still in Edmonton, which I hate. Still away from my sons which kills me. 

I've felt alone in the past. But I was always able to put it aside. That is no longer an option. Me and my brother are not that close. The house is a disaster. Overrun with pets, piss and shit everywhere. I've lived in basements for 3 of the last 5 years. I feel bunkered in.

Suicide is an idea I've played with in the past but I'm not playing anymore. Living on hope has run its course. Now I'm fighting to survive my own thought every day. This morning I woke up lonely and depressed only to see on the news as soon as I tuned it on that a pga tour golfer left a tournament early and killed himself. That flipped the switch. I'm ready to do it now. THEIRS NO REASON TO GO ON ANYMORE! Everyone takes the woman's side even if shes a cheating whore. Her friends, my friends, our friends. I think I can hold on till after Fathers Day. I don't want to put my dad though that, or my sons. But after June 16th I will be going forward with it. Im not proud to admit I'm this weak, but it's the truth.

6 years between them, they are 2 of the best sons anyone could ask for. The older one starts playing Jr A hockey this fall. 3 years ago that was nothing but a dream, now a reality. I trained him and the younger one through the COVID lock down. He went from not being on the radar for anything high level hockey to making the only team available at the time. Out of 200 hockey players he made the roster of 21. The younger one dominated hockey and football that fall and winter. He averaged 5 touchdowns a game vs Winnipeg teams with much better rosters.

So I can‚Äôt really trust men anymore, therefore I‚Äôm not even attracted to men anymore. 
My brain perceives men as out of control animals that would r4pe any woman they could if consequences didn‚Äôt exist.

When I was young I thought men couldn‚Äôt cry at all, because I‚Äôve never seen a man cry in my life. 

I understand a man has to provide, be strong, be stoic to be taken seriously by society. I think that‚Äôs wrong too. 

I STILL don‚Äôt want to be a woman, I don‚Äôt want to say being a woman is harder because I‚Äôve never been a man, but the blatant sexism, rape and crimes committed by men against women just either make me want to leave this earth, or transition to escape being the target.

So obviously the weak want to become strong, right? So they wouldn‚Äôt be perceived as weak and treated as inferior and weak. 

I noticed some women hate men too, I obviously know there are women like that and there are many of them. But I always thought of misandry of something like a push back, like some type of revenge, and not really hatred. I think that misogyny has always just been about hatred, like denying women‚Äôs rights and telling them they‚Äôre only useful for sex was never about revenge or a push back, it was hate that came from a sense of superiority.

And she wanted to know if they had found anything yet.  I knew it was the uro telling her to pump me for questions about what I've been finding out.  Basically to see if I had proof cause he's worried.  I then said in a really aggravated tone that other doctors are still figuring out what he's done to me.

Sadly it still won't make me happy even if I win millions from a lawsuit and he goes to prison.  I'm broken.  Even if a doctor says heres the proof of damage.  There isn't anything that can be done.  I'm not coping well. | Sorry to hear that.  I had no idea simply letting a doctor examine me was enough to maim me.  I'm in shock everyday at my life. | I can't even orgasm anymore.  Can't ejaculate.  My dick and bulbocavernosous muscle are profoundly numb and dead.  The bulbocavernosous muscle is responsible for erections and ejaculations and that muscle I can feel is extremely numb along with the rest of my dick.  I honestly have no interest in sex anymore if I can't use my dick.  

I know my story is shocking and fucked up.  I don't know what I did to deserve this.  But it's just my luck.  Here in WV we don't have the brightest doctors.  I took a risk and it was a fucking mistake going to one for something like TRT.  I don't think I'll be around much longer | It is I'm fucked.  I feel like I have a genuine reason to want to end it | Thank you and sorry that happened to you.  People don't realize that suing someone is not that simple and easy.  Especially doctors they can be untouchable it seems.  It's the irony that kills me knowing I went to a doctor to improve my health and it got destroyed instead.  I was supposed to feel safe in the presence of a doctor and I feel so betrayed.  I had no idea what he was gonna do.  I was told nothing.  I have been careful my whole life around doctors because I thought they were always too pushy with unnecessary medications.  It makes it that much harder to cope that the one time I trust one something as horrific as this happens.  I didn't deserve this.  I just want this nightmare to end. | I've tried Viagra and nothing happens.  I even combined it with cialis and still nothing.  When I say it's dead it feels dead from the nerves being shut off to it.  It hangs lifelessly because of that.  There must still be blood flow going in and out for the tissues to still be ""alive"". | I have tried several times.  That place is so over saturated with posts things get buried quick | An implant still wouldn't bring back my sensation.  I'm just so numb that even if I were able to get erections I wouldn't be able to feel or enjoy them.  I just want this to be over at this point. | Thanks.  You have seen it I've posted before.  It's ruined my life. | It is really fucked up.  I can't believe this is my life honestly.  It's like something out of a nightmare.  Can anyone really blame me for being on this subreddit? | This has me crying everyday.  I know my situation is very fucked up and I can't believe something like this has happened to me.  I can't believe something like this is even possible.  I don't know how much time I have left anymore | They have to be licensed in WV | Apparently some urologists justify it as checking penis elasticity, reflexes, or for plaque.  They can be really rough and I got the roughest by a psychopath.  He ruined my life and I am wanting it to end. | Hi I went in for low testosterone and to try to get HCG to keep my fertility.  My lab work showed I was low T.  I had low libido, low energy, and I happened to check a erectile dysfunction box on my sign in paper work .  But I didn't have erectile dysfunction.  I just had infrequent erections but all I could choose on my sign in paper work was low libido and erectile dysfunction.  So I checked both.  He said so you have erectile dysfunction?  I said very mild not really I think it's related to my low testosterone.  He said testosterone does nothing for erections.  Which is flat out wrong.  I just said oh well that's not what I've always learned.  We talked for a bit and then as I was about to leave he said let's go do a quick exam on my breathing.  Yes breathing.  I said ok.  When I get in the exam room he closes the door behind me and says to take off my pants and get in the exam table.  I was caught off guard but I just agreed because I didn't want to make things awkward by saying no.  He was a professional just doing his job I thought.  Biggest mistake of my life.  I wish I just listened to my gut and said I'm good down there.  But I didn't and now I'm ruined because of it.

I have seen multiple other urologists.  My last one was at Cleveland clinic and she didn't know anything either.  I was in the appointment for 5 minutes after driving 5 hours.

I'm sorry to hear about your bladder disease issues.  Losing yourself sexually is hard to cope with.  I personally don't think I can do it.  My sex drive was part of who I was.  And now the profound numbness and pressure I feel down there drives me crazy.

I don't know if I have it in me to continue talking to lawyers or doctors anymore.  I know the damage is unfixable anyway.  I don't know how much longer I'll be here. | Thank you.  I do consider it sexual assault but other urologists and doctors don't see it that way.  They just say it's normal to stretch and pinch/crush on the penis during exams.  I try to tell them how hard he did it and they still act like it can't be injured like that unless he was being crazy.  They basically don't know what to do with me and don't even want to get involved.  I get it.  I wouldn't want to deal with a patient that claims he got injured from an exam either.  But I'm a real victim of this man that has ruined my body and my life in one of the worst ways imaginable.

I don't see justice coming.  No legal justice anyway.  He can just say he did everything by the book and that what he did didn't cause my issues.  I'm just fucked.  I cry everyday over how constantly uncomfortable i feel and over what I've lost.  I don't believe I have it in me to fight this anymore. | I'm sorry to you as well.  Yes it's so difficult to get lawyers to take on medical cases.  Unless you have substantial proof no lawyers want to be involved.  I too can't get a doctor to agree that what the uro did to me was the cause.  I have given up on lawyers.  Thank you for the comment but I'm just counting my days now. | I think it does happen regularly.  My own primary care provider sympathized with me because he said he went to a urologist once and the guy examined his testicles and squeezed them like he tried to crush them.  He said he almost punched the guy and yelled at him wtf he was doing.  He said after that he would absolutely believe they would injure a penis like what happened to me.  One guy I talked to said the uro pulled his penis and let go of it like you were starting a lawnmower.  Crazy inhumane shit.  The people I've talked with online have mostly been around the world unfortunately. | In the penis enlargement communities there are men that have been permanently injured by stretches.  One bad stretch leaves them with a numb penis and severe ED.  Look up jelqing injuries too.  The penis is not indestructible. | To the uro he views it as he did nothing wrong.  I called him the day after because I was sore and numb and couldn't get any erection.  I asked him could it have been what he did during the exam.  He said no I may have hurt my back getting up off the exam table.  I said no my backs fine.  And then he said I sounded stressed and asked if I had anything going on in my life.  I felt gaslit.  I said I'm only worried about this because I don't know what's going on.  He got defensive and said I assure you it's nothing from the exam causing your symptoms.  I kept my composure and said what should I do?  He said try taking some ibuprofen and waiting or come back and I'll examine you again.  I wanted to throw up when he said it because I knew I had been injured and he wasn't admitting it.  I said I'll let him know and I immediately went to my PCP and told her what he had done to me and I needed another urologist.

I'll see about a penile angiogram thank you. | I scheduled a Doppler ultrasound for the 19th.  I'm scared of it tbh.  Some guys have reported being hurt by the injections during doppler.  They inject your penis with a drug to give an erection.  I believe it only tests the blood flow in the penis and not the nerves.  But I guess I will still try it.  I don't think my penis is going to get an erection from the shot.  It's that dead.  If it does then my blood flow is good so maybe that would confirm it's a nerve issue?  Idk I'm just so hopeless about whatever I find out. | It's because it's his word against mine basically.  Some lawyers have told me medical malpractice cases are some of the hardest to actually win.  Some have said the only cases they take are ones like wrongful deaths, bad surgeries that resulted in someone becoming paralyzed.  I guess I sound like a minor case on the phone.  To them I'm probably just a guy that claims his penis got damaged from an exam which I know they've never heard of.  I hadn't either.  But I've even tried telling them it was extremely rough how he did it.  I've even tried saying I viewed it as sexually assault because I didn't give consent on him touching my penis.  I thought I was getting checked for hernias.

I've had some doctors they don't know of any imaging on the penis.  They say it wouldn't show nerve damage even if it was there.  I'm just so exhausted from doctors and lawyers at this point.  Even if I became rich my penis is still gone which depresses me. | Does he have a license for WV? | I've tried but lawyers don't want it and I've got to the point I don't even care about lawsuits anymore.  I just want it to end.  I went to Cleveland Clinic urology who said they didn't think he was rough enough to damage anything.  I even told them I've found reports of injuries like this happening before from exams.  They just said to try pelvic floor exercises and I could come back if it doesn't help.  Already been doing those exercises for months with no change.  Doctors just don't know what they're doing. | There are others.  There have been others that have reported being injured by rough urologist exams.  One guy said in a post that a uro pulled his penis really hard and fast and then let go.  He said like what you do when starting a lawnmower.  He said the uro told him this was to test for a reflex in the penis.  Makes me think that what he was doing to me.  Checking my reflex.  It's supposed to check the bulbocavernosous reflex and ironically that's the muscle that i can now feel is dead and numb. | I really don't know why some uros have been reported to do this.  I know they don't treat their own dick like that.  It seems sadistic.  I wish every second of the day I never let that man come near me. | I already reported him to the hospital he works for.  The patient advocate told me the vice president of physicians would be calling that day.  I waited and never received a call.  Next day I called and couldn't get the patient advocate to answer.  I left a message asking her to call me and next person that called me was the uro's receptionist.  She said she wanted to know what my complaint was about my appointment with them.  I had already told her back when it first happened.  I explained to her again that he injured me and my penis is numb and broke with severe ED and my life is ruined.  She asked if I had been seeing other doctors and I said yes.  She asked if they had found anything wrong yet.  I knew it was the uro trying to get her to pump me for info because he might be scared.  I told her they're working on it in an aggravated tone.  After that the conversation was over.  I regretted answering the phone but I was so upset.  The hospital has been ghosting me ever since.  It's probably because nobody wants to talk to me in case I try to sue.  My life has been fucking ruined because of this doctor.  I have called almost every medical malpractice lawyer in my state of WV.  I struggle to even care about lawyers anymore.  I just want my life to be over now as bad as it sounds. | Do people even read newspapers anymore? | I'm actually on TRT since which is the best aphrodisiac there is.  It actually gives me great libido mentally.  But physically I'm destroyed because my penis is basically disconnected. | I have not.  I can't imagine it being worse than American healthcare.  What's the name of the hospital. | I tried once and could not get it up or feel anything with her.  Even with high dose Cialis.  My life is ruined. | I don't know why he would want to but who knows.  There are just sadistic people I know.  I'm going to try to assume it was severe carelessness.  He was very rough.  I was sore for two weeks after and had electric shock nerve pains that shot thru my penis for two weeks as well | I'm sorry man.  Physical problems can be the worst.  I've thought tho I would rather have almost any other physical problem than this.  I would give up my legs before my dick.  I just can't take this anymore | That was my own mother that told me to ""just get over it"".  She said I was weak for letting this affect me so much.  I told her that doctor just killed your son and that's all you can say?  I haven't spoken to her since.  She was never caring.  She was one of the few people I've told in real life and it was a mistake. | I know maybe it would be proof.  Or maybe not.  I just so depressed that I am still damaged in the end. | I wouldn't enjoy a payout without my dick.  Nothing can make this nightmare end. | I got hard copies of my medical records from everyone.  I had severe swelling of my penis veins afterwards that I took pictures of.  No bruising.  Thing is I was seeing him over low T and fertility.  I never had full on erectile dysfunction only infrequent erections due to low libido.  But on my chart he wrote that I said I had some erectile dysfunction.  Which could obviously be interpreted as me having ED before I saw him.  Low T has a symptom of erectile dysfunction but I never had trouble getting an erection when I was low.  My low T has since been corrected but my penis is still broken. | I really don't care about getting rich anymore | Medical malpractice cases are notoriously hard to win apparently.  I just read an article describing a large scale study that found that doctors won 80-90 percent of jury trials that involve weak evidence of negligence. | I told another urologist and she said oh we stretch penises all the time that's normal.  But I told her he pulled it extremely hard to the point it caused me an injury.  She said well it's not supposed to be done hard like that.  But her saying stretching is normal is probably enough for this uro to get out of a lawsuit.  Idk anymore | Thank you.  I have not contacted them no.  I feel like I would be treated the same as other lawyers.  Nobody takes me seriously even tho I try to explain how rough he was.  I mean nobody even knows what to say when I tell them.  Which I understand cause it is such a strange case.  I've even reminded them of technically not giving consent to touch my penis.  Doesn't matter.  Still nobody wants the case.  This has me hopeless and I just have lost interest in lawsuits anymore.  My penis is still gone unfortunately.  All feeling is gone.  Just uncomfortablely numb jelly inside and out.  The inside of the penis being numb is what really drives me crazy.  I used to be able to feel the blood rushing thru it during erections and I had control over ""bouncing"" it but not anymore.  Can't get an erection at all anymore because the nerves/muscle is damaged most likely.  I feel like I got sent to hell and there's no way out. | That's for taking the time to find him.  Unfortunately it says on that page he only serves Maryland, dc, and Virginia.  I'm in West Virginia. | I'm in West Virginia.  A lawyer would have to be licensed in my state in order to take my case.  I've called a few out of state and they say they can't do anything in WV anyway. | You're right I'm sorry I didn't mean it that way.  I'm just really struggling rn | I know I'm sorry I'm just really struggling.  I've heard an EMG can't test penile nerves | I'm sorry but I have given up on lawyers.  I've been referred to many.  Still nobody wants my case.  It's impossible.  I am just counting my days now. | This made me tear up.  I wish I could believe that many people would be on my side.

I have no financial means or support from anyone to pursue my dreams of travelling the world. I know its such a privileged answer but I genuinely have missed out so much in life due to financial constraints since young and I dont blame my parents at all. We have what is enough but a part of me still wants to travel and the only way to make big bucks is for me to study and pursue my education to get a high paying job but I know damn well that is not going to happen so I‚Äôm just finishing my diploma and just attempt to apply to universities just to make my parents proud and hopeful. Thats my dream which is just to see whether I am eligible to uni just to make my parents feel a bit happy?

u/PerspectiveUnfair851,178,"I wish the world was kinder There are so many good things in life that make it worth living, but it only takes one terrible thing to shatter your life into a living nightmare worse than death, and there are plenty more vile things in the world than there are good ones. 

I see so many people wishing to die for a plethora of different reasons, valid reasons to be upset about life because of them, but it‚Äôs horrible that it can push us so far as to want to die just to stop experiencing them. What‚Äôs worse is that I feel like almost all of them are due directly or indirectly by someone else‚Äôs hand. 

I‚Äôve seen people take their life after being sexually assaulted, physical abuse, child exploitation and abuse. I‚Äôve seen people not be able to afford living while others happily take advantage of their power and do anything to increase their wealth. I‚Äôve seen medical professionals use their patients as mere objects, even those in the mental health services treat patients in dire need less than the trash on the street. I‚Äôve seen systems set in place in society, meant to have strict rules to minimize and nullify abuse of power be treated as mere suggestions as they do whatever they want on whim, regardless of the consequences it‚Äôll have on others. 

Thing is, there are plenty of kind and good people out there, feeling fulfilled by doing any little thing to spread kindness and make the world just a little bit better, but it‚Äôs all for naught. There‚Äôs only so much they can do before they‚Äôre beaten down into submission, put down like a mere statistic as their work and everything they‚Äôve done for others is destroyed, nullified and anything of value is scrapped by those hungry, greedy vultures who want it all for themselves. They can claim otherwise, they can claim to be helping people but it‚Äôs all an act in order to satisfy critiques and seem genuine when deep down they don‚Äôt care. 

I wish it wasn‚Äôt like this. It‚Äôs childish wishing the world was like a fairytale, but I‚Äôd like to see how a world with people assisting and helping each other, instead of taking advantage of each other and stabbing themselves in the back, would look like.

I get so irrationally angry at people who commit suicide because of love. I know they have their own monsters to fight, but I mean, do you have any idea how good you have it in life ??? 
You have a full fucking life, while I'm stuck living half for whatever duration I live because that's the fucking done thing in my country. It's just study and work and none of the good parts. High taxation with none of the facilities to make it worth it. People casually being horrible every chance they get and people being literally everywhere. 
Overcrowding. Overpopulation. Pollution. No work-life balance. No way to have a healthy student life. 
What is the point ????? 
I'm fucking done. 

I wish if reincarnation exists next life I can be born somewhere where I have an easier life.

u/Pleasant_Shoe_7856,400,"I asked all of my friends to come over for for a drink so I could see them all one last time and none showed up To be fair, there‚Äôs only 6 of them. Everyone‚Äôs home from college for the summer so I was just hoping to see them one more time. They all said yes but either cancelled this morning or didn‚Äôt show up without saying anything.
so now I‚Äôm just sitting here with 24 cupcakes I made, some spinach dip and salads. I also now have 72 cookies because I baked them each a dozen cookies to take home.

I‚Äôm honestly more sad about the fact in a couple weeks they‚Äôll probably feel guilty about it, but it‚Äôs not really their fault because they didn‚Äôt know it was their last chance to see me.

I‚Äôm so mad at myself for trying to set this up. I should have known they wouldn‚Äôt want to come, because they don‚Äôt invite me when they hangout. I try not to bother people but I just wanted a little closer, I mean we were friends ever since we were little girls. I think we were all 3/4 when our moms became friends. 

 and now innocent people are probably going to have guilt/regrets about not coming.

And I guess I have friends, none of them showed up though so I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a reason to stick around lol | Well here‚Äôs a list of a few
When I was 14 my mom died in her sleep. my brother got addicted to drugs because of it and left. My dad started dating a year later and I got abused by my step family, he took their side and hardly talks to me but paid for her kids to go to university.
I went from one abusive household to another, and I will be 25 in February and have no money, no education and if I try to leave my husband I will be dead anyways. Even if I got out alive I have 12k in student loan debt from one year of college that I failed out of, I don‚Äôt have my own credit card anymore or my own car. 
Ending my own life peacefully is 100% the best way out. | Yeah I completely disagree, there‚Äôs really nothing a therapist can do to fix anything other than my mindset. And for my personal issues mindset doesn‚Äôt change anything | It won‚Äôt. If therapy could fix my issues I promise I would be going, but there is zero chance. Unless that therapist has some magical powers and can wave a wand and fix my completely messed up family, bring my mom back, get rid of my abusive husband and somehow come up with enough money for me to get away with him, and then take me back 5 years so I could have a career. Then maybe I‚Äôd go. And even if I wanted to, my husband would never in a million years let me see a therapist, he didn‚Äôt even want me to have friends over. I‚Äôm almost 25 and I don‚Äôt have a single dollar or education. | Even if I get away from him I have no education money or work experience, And no matter how bad he treats me I‚Äôd take him over my family any day, so it‚Äôs not like if I get out I have a support system. 

Leaving a relationship like this one is also not as easy as going to a women‚Äôs shelter. If I try to leave I‚Äôll be dead anyways, I‚Äôd rather do it on my own terms. | I totally get it you‚Äôre trying to help and I appreciate it but that is not an option for me, and won‚Äôt help me. My cop husband would have me pulled over before I ever got to the shelter. 

And honestly even if there was a slim chance I wouldn‚Äôt take it. Like I said I‚Äôm almost 25, I don‚Äôt exactly have years and years to figure things out anymore. Even if I do leave, get therapy, save money, go to school, everyone else my age has their own place, degree and job. There‚Äôs not much point in starting now just to be able to rent a crappy apartment by the time I‚Äôm 30 | Like I said, a women‚Äôs shelter will not help me. I get it people are trying to help but I don‚Äôt think any of you understand how hard it is to leave someone who works in law enforcement and won‚Äôt face consequences. Even if I get to a safe place it won‚Äôt be safe when he tracks me down in a week. | Yeah in a perfect world that would all happen, but that‚Äôs not how it will happen. I get it from the outside it seems like it should be that easy, but it‚Äôs not. I have tried to leave, and I can tell you right now how it‚Äôll end if I try again.
And in the slim chance I do get out, it‚Äôs not like I have a good life waiting for me just because he‚Äôs gone. 

Im definitely not the first woman to be abused by a cop, there‚Äôs a reason abuse is so high in this profession.

Daughter(14) tried to commit suicide Sunday night by taking a lethal dose of Tylenol and Advil.  Luckily school has been hitting the suicide hot line pretty hard with the students and she texted them before and after taking the pills.  They were able to convince her to give up our address.  Wife and I were home and had no idea until a frantic police man came up to the door.  Long story short, she survived with no permanent damage.  She started inpatient care yesterday.  We went thru her phone and the texts to the hot line indicate she has been having these feelings for two years.  We started going thru her room today and found her note.  It was addressed to her best friend and didn't even mention my wife and I.  That was a gut punch.  This was so out of the blue.  She is such a great kid.  Fantastic grades, lots of friends, very well liked at school, and highly empathetic towards others.  In her texts to the hot line, she was guilt ridden on how good her life was.

u/Prestigious-Owl-1433,151,"My family just killed me As dramatic as it sounds, it's true. The family I prayed to God to protect everyday has killed me.

TL;DR: my dad cancelled my flight ticket back to Canada so now i may never get into my dream school.

At this point they might as well throw me into a well and let me starve to death in peace cause there is no mending the amount of betrayal I feel. Once I was told this I was at loss for words. I had to park my car and scream so loud people passing by were shocked. I am as good as dead I'm telling you. I begged this man, send me one month's allowance and I'll go back to Canada without bothering you for more money. I haven't even thought about first and last month's rent or anything really. I just want to be in school and figure it out later. I've already told them, if you think I was mentally ill before, now it's time to run mad for making me lose an opportunity to go to the school of my dreams and if that puts me strapped in a hospital for years, so be it. My life is as good as over anyway. There is nothing for me anywhere else. I am fucking sick and tired of being sick and tired. I've talked this over with my therapist and he said my parents are wrong for this and in the end it doesn't even matter cause once I'm gone I hope they burn in the deepest pits of hell. I have literally no one on my side. I am tired. 

Edit: someone said I felt ""entitled"" and I'm looking for attention and I should go get a job and student loans. I'm $50k in student debt and I had a full time job that they made me leave for the ""vacation"" they promised me only for my vacation to turn to jail time. If you think I haven't done anything to avoid this from happening to me, you're wrong.

Another edit: they literally told me that I was coming to relax and I shouldn't even work so Ofc I thought to myself that a ""vacation"" will be a nice reset. But unfortunately I was BAMBOOZLED. I'm telling you there's nothing I haven't tried the last 12 months, like literally nothing. Nothing at all.

Edit 3: also considering he cancelled a flight that I paid him for and now I'm asking for one month's allowance which is less than full refund amount, I'd say that word entitled doesn't even apply. I'm literally willing to live in a shelter if things don't work out. Nothing about me is entitled, I've had to work for everything I own, he's never had to pay for my clothing or lifestyle since starting uni. My first phone was from me, my first car was from me. Entitled people wouldn't even be able to survive in my family.

Edit 4: before even purchasing the ticket this man promised me and said all I had to do was NOTHING and I'll be well taken care of with a good allowance cause I won't be here for long. Now all promises have been broken and now I have to ""prove"" I'm worthy of furthering my education? The people calling me a spoiled rich kid are actually funny af you guys shouldn't be having kids tbh.

Final edit: *SUICIDEWATCH* a subreddit dedicated to suicide prevention has people telling other people to go ahead and do it. I went from being ready to die (still am) to wanting to rid the world of some of you online psychopaths.

",u/Prestigious-Owl-1433,-34,"An adult with zero resources when I could have had what I needed if I stayed where I was. Sending your kids to school actually doesn't set them up for success unless you're talking private schools, no student loans, no credit card debt and a fully rented apartment.

Edit: my point is, there's no ""for sure"" way to set your kids up for success without spending ridiculous amounts of money that more than 50% of people will never be able to afford.

Edit 2: i think ""setting"" your kids up for success is unrealistic for most people because all an average person can do is sacrifice for their kids. That's real success- the best you can. I don't think it's about how much money you spend, it's about how you choose to spend what you have with your family. | Yeah, but he just bought a new house in cash for hundreds of thousands, now all of a sudden he's not liquid enough to pay my rent? What the actual fuck is that? That's why he can't send his only dependent child to school? He's just a piece of shit honestly and doesn't care about my life clearly, so there's no point.

Edit: if you read the post you would see that I'm not asking him to pay my rent, I'm asking him to pay me less than the ticket's refund amount as an ""allowance"" and I'll use the rest of my savings to survive when I get there.

Edit 2: the downvotes on this are literally so ridiculous, this isn't the 90s to early 2010s where late entrance into university is normalized. The competition in my field has gotten even more insane since COVID and a degree is a life jacket. These new jobs after COVID have changed a lot of requirements. They see a long unexplained gap in your education and they start calculating risks and end up giving the job to anyone else but you. | The fact that all my efforts to get into the literal best school in the country are now in vain because my parents wanted an 11th house, is actually fucking insane. The reason is that I'm mentally ill and taking my medication but I still have to prove to them my ""readiness"" to finish my education. The fact that I'm still alive is literally all you need to go to school. My therapist can handle the rest. | There really isn't for me, I've spent 12 months considering every other option. | Yes parents aren't obligated to help, and I knew this which is why I started working before I was even allowed to. Where in the post did I ever say he was obligated to pay for my fees or rent? But why promise to help then help half way? Why give so many assurances if you're not capable of living up to your word? It would've been much better if he didn't help at all in the first place by inviting me to take a ""break"" full of lies. If he didn't help, I would've still had more than enough saved for me to patiently wait for a new job. Even if I had to sleep in a shelter for weeks. | Thank you | I spent 12 months anticipating school then he cancelled my ticket the last month when I already spent a good chunk of my savings. Now I should do what? Just do what exactly? I don't qualify for loans and the jobs without degrees here will take me forever to buy a ticket. Privilege is even more dumb to use for my situation than entitled. Where the fuck is the advantage I've received huh? Cancelling my ticket, putting my education on hold for another year and not even giving me an allowance to save and do things with where I currently am, after being promised crazy amounts. Please just find sense. | you are not the first person nor will you be the last to state the fucking obvious LOL | If a milli drops from the sky rn, I'd be happy to. If not?

Edit: this is clearly light hearted, like my whole entire family has never seen 1M all at once lmao | Thank you!!! | High expectations???? At this point, I know some people had decent enough parents to understand where I'm coming from. Clearly not you tho.

Edit: still laughing at the high expectations this person is talking about cause I've searched and searched and I still can't find it. I was already in university before my mental health break and if I was left where I was, I wouldn't be where I am today.

Edit 2: that pity hole comment is crazy cause this is a valid response to your dreams shattering. | I hope the down-voters are better parents than this cause it's evident y'all will end up as shitty parents lol | We have heard. You've deleted your last comment so Idg why you're still lurking on a suicide page? Get a lifeüëã I haven't stated where I'm from, never even said I was African.

If I was abandoned in Canada it would be a different thing. | Thank you, while I appreciate what you're saying which is not to end my life, I also think our situations are no where near similar. This isn't me complaining about my parents not being able to pay my fees or my rent. This is about my terrible parents continuing to be terrible just because they want to. I have never been close with my family but when it came to education my dad always promised us the world. Now that he can't afford what he used to be able to, I'm not asking for much at all, cause I know he's entitled to his money but missing a scholarship opportunity only for me to be deeper in debt is insane.

Your parents sacrificed a lot for you growing up and I think that's literally the bare minimum to being a good parent, that's setting your kids up for success even if you don't have enough, it's not about the money for me. it's about the lack of consideration, the lies, deception and manipulation for me. What your parents did is commendable while my parents couldn't even sacrifice an 11th house for me. Our situations are miles and miles apart.

Edit: this wasn't meant to come off as rude as the other comments I've made cause he's kind enough to give his input, but all I'm saying is I would've preferred my lifestyle growing up to be cut in half if it meant my parents would be willing to sacrifice things they don't need for things I actually need. Like for example, when I was in high school my parents wouldn't be able to pay my fees on time, but they'd buy boats and jet skis not as a business but as a hobby. It's super insensitive when you guys act like this feeling came out of nowhere. | I made the wrong decision to trust my family, now I'm paying dearly for it. They were extremely convincing and I had no reason to doubt them, even after many years of disappointment from them. | Entitled??? Lmaooo maybe you can do this to your own child. But I can never. Having 10 houses, but choosing between getting an 11th house and your daughter's education but you choose a house? Lol fair enough. Not even sure you know what entitled means. It means believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment. Special treatment where? This man does not pay my tuition, and I got into the school on a fucking scholarship. What about that is entitled? Making your child miss an opportunity you're not even fully paying for is crazy. Like I said in the post I asked him for one month's allowance and nothing else even though I know he can afford to if he wanted to. | I had a mental breakdown cause I couldn't find a place to live even though I had the deposits. I had no family support so it made things much harder. So I was told I needed do nothing for a month or so which was going to be fine cause I would get benefits for the time being. So my dad begged me to leave my job and therefore lose my benefits. But 1 month turned into a year of unfulfilled promises. I have my medication now and I'm happy to do what needs to get done, I just had to get there. Even if I had to stay at a shelter for a few weeks, I wouldn't care, as long as I was making steps to reach my goal. | How tf does ""prove my readiness to finish my education"" not mean the same thing as ""prove my readiness to live alone""? I literally have to live without my parents to finish my education. So stop talking stupid shit like my story isn't staying the same, if your mental capacity isn't able to put two and two together, all you have to do is ask and I can connect the dots for you, like I have done here. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Edit: I didn't say the house was the reason, I clearly spelt out the word REASON so no one would get confused and I said the REASON was having to prove to them my ""readiness"" to finish my education. | Oh Technical Analyst | Lol you're not serious. Literally everyone's situation can be worse than it is. But yes, I want to die for very valid reasons. If i was homeless and couch surfing I would take full responsibility for myself and figure myself out. Like I said in the post. The spoiled rich girl angle is dead tbh. You can't even spell a word as simple as quadriplegic but you want to give advice. Ok. | Thank you. | From my parents. |  Lmaoooo Nope, you're a bloody liar. You literally had a comment implying I was being ""passive aggressive"" and you used the ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è emoji at the end of it. It's no longer on your profile, so please stop lying, I have a screenshot of it so don't think you're smart. You're as stupid as they come cause tell me why you've told me to fuck off twice under MY post. Lol , you didn't have to be here to start with. Probably your childhood trauma is worrying you, frankly, I don't give a fuck.

Edit: This Kenyan buffoon made another comment saying that the comment was still on his profile and and I should fuck off and go cry in my car again. Lol but yet again, he deleted it. | Lol that's untrue. If the mod deleted it, it'll be on your profile. But keep lurking Mr. Kenya. | Look, if you had good parents who raised you well enough to prepare you for independence, great. Good for you. But there are MANY people like me... who have spent their whole lives waiting for the day they leave the narcissistic household they grew up in. So like I said in another thread, you can decide to call this good parenting but you will never know how bad they've been all my life.

Of course the vacation was for my mental health? I literally said that the therapist recommended taking one month off and to please my family and ease their worries I decided to multiply that by 12. In the past 12 months I've seen multiple therapists and psychiatrists and they've assessed me and concluded that I have my medication and I am going to need to stay on it to avoid another break down. Fair enough. Which is not hard to do since I get medication for free in Canada. So do my parents know more than 10 therapists and psychiatrists? Obviously not. So please don't project your privilege of having decent parents blind you from the fact that other people's experiences are valid as well.

I am asking for one month's allowance simply so I don't have to ask for too much? If I ask for $10,000 dollars that will set me up for months, Do you think it would encourage their decision to send me there? Ofc not. And here all you are, talking shit about being entitled. Before my mental health break I had no contact with my family for 1 year.

Edit: even if I have traits that have to be worked on, that's no reason to stop my education if you're a good parent. Taking a break was fine, I accepted there were things I had to work on; but those traits are a work in progress. Nothing happens overnight. | Thank you so much, it's really refreshing reading this after reading what the farts for brains on this post have had to say the last few hours. | At which point did I brag about shit? Getting my first phone or getting my first car? Those aren't even life achievements so what exactly are you ""seeing through""? I'm not fucking entitled and I know it, I don't care if you do. Idgaf. Not going to lie, you're right about the tantrums, I will do better. | I paid my dad the money for that ticket, and he cancelled it without giving me any warning or anything. No refund either. I stayed for 12 months anticipating my return to my education and after that many months, of course my savings aren't what they used to be. So naturally I can't afford yet another ticket. To get a loan you either have to be employed here or have large collateral so that's not an option. I'm not able to work here cause I haven't completed my education so I know they'll pay me pennies for my work. | Ok tristan1616, you clearly know more about a country I've been in for 12 months. Idiot. | Lol may your generation will be poor, idiot. | I saw the comment you deleted, and I wish you kept it up, so people can see how wicked you truly are. | I should care if you're a native English speaker when you don't care if I'm actually about to pull the trigger of a gun I could possibly be holding? I wish I knew your native language so I can copy and paste as many insults as I can in this comment section. you're able to type full sentences in a suicide watch thread but I'm meant to assume English is your second language? Lol please, spare me your dumb bullshit. | I'm Canadian. When I left Canada I bought a round trip ticket but because my dad had a better deal with his miles, I paid him for the ticket. Which in hindsight I didn't have to do, he found out how much I had and started acting strange. But I was vulnerable and fresh out the psych ward. I was working at a bank for my internship while studying. Yes therapist said 1 month break but it became 1 year as a ""compromise"" to get me back to school in September as promised. Yes they don't think I'm mentally stable, but in reality, neither are they so I don't think their point of view is as clear as they think it is. Mother suffers from crippling anxiety and panic attacks and father has mood issues that look and sound bipolar. I just happen to have the most narcissistic parents on earth. Cursed to bits. | The fact you keep coming back to the thread to respond to other people that haven't responded to you is exactly what the word lurking means. So please, those fuck offs you've been deleting from this thread, take your own advice and stop being an asshole- FUCK OFF. | Look, while I appreciate the sentiment, this is still another situation that I can't relate to in anyway. Cause first my parents have always been financially comfortable enough to provide for my 3 older siblings without a problem. 


Secondly, my older sister also went to private school but not because she needed it, but because he always gave her whatever she wanted while I was stuck in public school and basically forgotten about. The only time I aced all my grades was the the year before getting admission into university cause that was when I realized my life is my own and no one else's. 

So going into university I knew I had to work hard and save harder just incase my dad tries to fuck me over, and that's exactly what I did. I was able to get my shit together on my own. 

My parents see mental illness as a disease that can end my life while I see it as a superpower that can extend my life. Cause I am more understanding and empathetic of other mentally ill people and first hand, I have watched people become homeless just because the mental health system failed them.

Literally 2 years before my breakdown my parents had not sent me one dime, so you think I hadn't already known that no one else can help me but me? Of course I knew that. Getting into admitted into the hospital was necessary but what wasn't necessary was my family taking over my life.

Edit: just to clarify my privilege comment: you've always known what you had to do cause your parents gave you no other option. But while they took your other options away, they also gave you reasons for doing so. My parents have no other reason apart from being mentally ill  which multiple psychologists have said will be ok as long as I take my medication- but they believe more in their poor parenting styles than people with PhDs. Even though your parents had their faults they also taught you life lessons and showed their love for you in other ways. My parents have never taught me any life lesson and the only thing close to love we've ever received from them was an education. 

You may think I'm exaggerating but I rather have extremely poor parents that love me so much that they encourage me everyday to work hard and live a good life, than relatively rich parents who show no love and instead of encouraging me to live my life, make mistakes and pick myself up, they hold me hostage. Not as if they can't afford to sacrifice a lot more than I'm asking them for. That's literally the point I'm making. Idk what's so hard to understand really. | So how am I going to learn to do things on my own without actually experiencing doing things on my own? Are you actually fucking demented? If I fail on my own like I did when I had a mental breakdown and was admitted, does that mean it's the end of the world for me? Of course not, it just means I need to continue to take my medication and survive the best I can when the going gets tough. That's a valuable lesson parents teach their kids, that's support. It doesn't always have to be about money. I can couch surf or get shelter however I can but I can't get back the time I missed in school. | He cancelled it because, even against my therapist's advice, he thinks being mentally ill and on medication stops me from being a functional human being. | He has access to everything. He bought the ticket cause the miles he had made it a little bit cheaper, not even up to $100 but it seemed like a good save at the time. | Thanks! | Lmaoooo i haven't even mentioned the country my parents moved me to. You're actually foolish. Keep on. | At least I never went out of my way to comment things that may or may not push you over the edge on your suicide post. Save your deconstructive criticism for someone who sought your advice in the first place please. Assuming everyone posting on this subreddit is mentally ill, you are evil. | What do you mean ""another country"" I was born and raised in Canada you fool. My parents just left the country when I was a teenager. If I wasn't Canadian I wouldn't be fucking making this post DUMMY. And yes I said no other education is going to work because I had 12 months prior to this to apply for other options. If they told me this, 12 months ago it would be different. I wouldn't have been as relaxed as I was.

Edit: you're so dumb that you don't even read shit, you're just talking from a place of trauma. How the fuck does ""1 million falling from the sky"" not sound like a joke? Does money fall from the sky where you come from? I guess not fool. | You just said I've proven I can't do shit on my own but now you're saying ""Do them""??? After I've given reasons why I can't do them. Ok. | I asked him and he says I need to ""prove"" that I'm ready to live on my own. And by that he means I shouldn't be in my room as often as I am. But I'm literally isolated, away from everything I know, idk what he expects. All I know is, he thinks that playing golf and swimming would be enough to prove to him that I'm ready. Which makes no fucking sense cause I can do all these things and he will still make up another reason why I'm not ready. The truth is no one is ever ready, all you need is a therapist and you're good. And with the healthcare plans i have in Canada it's not impossible to figure things out.

You obviously won't get a reasonable loan if you're getting paid in pennies. You're maxed out at two or three times your paycheque with insane interest fees. | Spoiled rich kid? Lmaooooooü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ i think you're actually insane. Don't ever have kids so you don't get blood on your hands. Next. | ""Only school"" yeah cause you didn't work your ass off day and night, sacrifice your social life, and have someone literally hold you back for reasons beyond your control. I wouldn't be on this subreddit if I wasn't mentally ill, so if completing my college education is the most important thing in my life that I don't think I can live without, who are you to judge me? Not like I even asked for you to agree with me, if you lack empathy that much, just don't comment. Everyone's priorities are different, other people may have reasons to live like friends, family, talent, money, travel etc, but the only thing that has kept me from killing myself in the past 12 months has been taken away without warning. If you choose not to understand my perspective even a little bit, you are fucking evil. | Rightttt??? I just know he's an old, rich prick, typing in the comfort of his million dollar home. | That's better than whatever they think they're going to benefit by keeping me in this country. Couch surfing doesn't last forever. | I literally don't do those activities in Canada so I don't understand why I should be doing it elsewhere. Doing things around the house isn't going to prove shit. Also, why should I do anything when I was brought here with an initial mutual understanding that nothing is expected of me. And yes I asked him MULTIPLE times what exactly he wants me to do and he said ""I'm always in my room"" and basically said I refused to do anything. Maybe cause I was told I was on BREAK? What does golfing and swimming have to do with finishing my education? Nothing.

Edit: why should I be proving anything???? Like it's just so fucking dumb, I didn't ask to be here? But I need to prove myself to the people that forced me here? I'm not asking for something he can't afford- he doesn't pay my fees anyway.

Edit 2: the reason why it won't prove shit is because he pays someone to cook and clean and whether I help or not it won't matter. He made promises he couldn't keep and that's why I'm where I am. He literally told me the reason he's bringing me here is so all I have to do is NOTHING. Now he's switched up and said that I do things to prove to him I can go back? It doesn't make any fucking sense. | You are seeing this as ""good parenting"" fair enough. I see things differently and that's okay. I grew up with these people, I know how far their bad parenting rope would reach if I spread it down on the ground. Thanks for the interaction, your opinion is valid.

Edit: mind you, the person doesn't understand the emotional and verbal abuse I received all my life. At the end of the day, if I had made him sign a contract I'd be able to sue him. That's what I wish I could do, sue him for emotional and mental trauma. 

Edit 2: it's not about the money but he wants me to prove things. At this point, I understand where you're coming from 100% but I still disagree because of how dishonest I know my dad to be because although he claims it's not about the money, he spent all the money he would've used to help me out on a house. So when he says it's not about the money and it's about independence, i know for A FACT he's lying. I know it's about the money. And that's what's more annoying, cause he didn't have to blow it all at once but he just felt like.

u/Pristine_Cow1797,114,"If I were a dog I would have been euthanized by mow The worst part is I'm not exaggerating.

I am a medical disaster. I deal with symptoms so bad all I can do is lay in bed all day. If I do more than that my symptoms become even worse. It's chronic. No cure, no treatment. All because I was at the wrong place at the wrong time and got COVID.

A dog would have been put down for this. People would talk about how it was humane to euthanise it so it wasn't suffering longer.

So why isn't it the same for me? People like me suffer constantly yet we're expected to put up with it. Hell, some people accuse us of being lazy. It's insane.

Like I have no idea how on earth I could be alive in July. Before anyone suggests transitioning, I cannot. If I were to transition my wife will divorce me. I love her very much and she‚Äôs amazing. I need her in my life.

My one year trans anniversary is coming up on the 27th and I can‚Äôt bear it. I can‚Äôt bear to accept that I have to be cis now. The body I inhabit is not my own. It‚Äôs not me. Do you understand what it‚Äôs like to wake up and feel like you were forcibly stuffed into a costume? Do you know what it‚Äôs like to have a deep, deep need and desire to do something that will keep you alive just for everyone around you to say ‚Äúyeah but can you be alive in a way that makes me comfortable? Not like that‚Äù. I‚Äôve told people that if I don‚Äôt transition I will die and they don‚Äôt believe me. They must not because I cannot imagine them putting me through this intentionally, knowing that I meant what I said.

‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt it good to follow God?‚Äù No actually it isn‚Äôt. I would MUCH rather spend an eternity in the firey pits of hell as a woman than spend a single moment in heaven as a man. Sorry but eternally looking like this fucking freak is not for me.

I've been released from the psych ward and stuff, you can see it in more recent posts I've made lol

And genuinely, this helped me calm down just now after coming home from a visit to my Psychologist.

So thank you, genuinely, from the bottom of my heart. | It's not? The lethal limit of salt is around 0.5 grams per kg of body weight to 1 gram per kg of body weight.
You uh...  Wow. | Travelling?

Probably not dying, at hospital in the Children's urgent care thingy, but yeah still sucks (copypasting) | Because I ofcourse had salt around, and salt dissolved in water is WAY easier to convince myself to do, than jumping off a building or something.

If you're gonna poison yourself, use a different method than salt, it fucking sucks.

Everyone here is dealing with shit. I know it sounds rude, but it's unfortunately the truth

I mean I tried to kill myself on my birthday 4 days ago, and got released from the Psych ward yesterday right after a panic attack after seeing my horrible father.

This post isn't really the place to ask for sympathy, I'm sorry for that. It seems people are having a hard time empathizing with you because of your aggressiveness sadly. 

I hope you can get the help you need though and I wish you luck!!! | I didn't get far into Hypernatremia before I threw up in the hospital. But it still hurt a shit ton. Apparently it was only going to get more painful. Like AGONIZINGLY FOR HOURS until I fell into a coma and died from cardiac arrest.

I assume you're considering this method because of the vagueness of the question. 
#Don't. 
Even hanging would probably be better than this.

It would probably be nice if I could just say ""don't kill yourself"" and everything goes better for you. But since it won't, all I can do is say that you should choose s different method.

Salt poisoning sucks | If I didn't puke my fucking guts out, and and called an ambulance out of panic yes I would've. | I don't know, ask my psychologist lol | Fuck you. | Well it's not ideal, but I'm alive and probably not dying anymore, having to spend my 17th birthday in a hospital room is kind sad, but it's a funny story I guess | I vomited after I arrived at the hospital so they didn't have to pump my stomach lol. But I can imagine that the NURSE WHO'S ARMS I VOMITED INTO didn't enjoy me vomiting out my stomach, lol

So uhh that kinda saved me :3 | I'm at the psych ward now, feeling like shit but atleast I'm not suck in a bed with a bunch machined connected to me :3 | Almost anything can kill you if you try hard enough, but yeah table salt, really bad way too go... | It's agonizingly painful apparently, but I puked a shit ton after I arrived at the hospital | <3

BUT I DO HAVE 1 PAIR OF GRIPPY SOCKS :D

I think my bestfriend is probably my biggest reason to live and I love her (platonically) | I feel like shit, honestly I feel worse that I panicked and regretted it, rather than feeling bad that I'm almost dying lol | I'm 17 today, it's my birthday.
My dad doesn't know, somehow the ambulance didn't wake him up | I'm pagan, but thank you anyway!! | Thank you. | >hey, are you better now?

Well if by ""better"" you mean ""not dead"", then yeah. 
I stayed in the hospital and the psych ward a bit was released a while ago, I'm currently at home, and I've ""recovering"" away from school for awhile. My mental health isn't much better, but I'm not dead, so there's that.

>may i ask why is that bad advice

Well I was ACTIVELY DYING, when I made this post. If I didn't get medical attention there's a big chance I would've been dead now. ""Drinking water"" won't do much against a coma, brain-bleeding and Cardiac arrest.

>how they treated you in hospital?

It was a while ago now, and my memory from the day is kinda fuzzy. But they got me to throw up, and they gave me medicine that caused me to pee alot, and gave me loads of sweet drinks so that I could clean out the sodium from my body. They also had me hooked up to a heart monitor, and a blood pressure monitors. And they had fluids injected with IV straight into my arm.

Staff were ***mostly*** professional, and treated me well since it was my birthday. | Thank you. ü´°ü´° o7 | Hypernatremia in later stages causes bleeding in the brain, I have puked alot though | Lol, I've puked most of it out though probably not going to get that bad | I wish so too :3 | Thank you!!! I hope so as well, I'm glad I got to keep my phone, it's 06:49 am though so I don't have many to talk with, lol | Probably lol, but I feel kinda shit that I didn't go through with it, kinda glad that I'm alive and I'm properly recognized for my struggles, might get some more serious help, lol | I'm currently having fun drawing!! The freedom from responsibilities feels amazing!! üòçüòçüòç
Saw another patient finally I think. lol | If I'm okay? Not really, I'm spending my birthday at the hospital, lol | :3 | I'm at the psych ward now!, when you commented I was probably asleep, they take my phone away at 10pm, and you sent that when it was 1am my time. It's now 11:30 and I just ate breakfast :3. | Lol, it's fine, I have insomnia anyway and I woke up at 4pm yesterday anyway, my sleep schedule is fucked

Still kinda sucks tho

Well I might be in grippy sock jail tomorrow, or I'll be scolded by my shitty dad, or I might not be discharged by then and I have to sleep in hospital

But yeah probably not as bad still | Lol, Thank you!! | [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/celestegame/s/hxVyqvRbUG) is a reddit post of the picture I drew!!! :3 | Thank you!! And yeah I hope so aswell, might be sent to the psych ward for this one, lol | I lose my phone in 11 minutes due to a curfew thingy, so I can't write a proper response before tomorrow. but have fun in the meantime lol | > they thrown you into an asylum before?

I haven't suprisingly enough, after my first attempt i totally expected them too lol, but I was just referred to a psychologist lmao

But yeah might be a good thing, I've only heard good things, plus I'm also 17 now, lol | YES | I'm Norwegian, the one that I'm in right now seems lovely :D | Grippy sock jail :3 | THANK YOU!! Hopital is silly, but yeah probably the smarter choice than puking out my innards trying to sleep and falling into a coma and dying painfully
But yeah thanks! | 
>Maybe salt was a bad idea eh?

Lol

But yeah the staff here are pretty good, except for like one who is teasing me for ""being a guy surrounded by Women"" bruh
I'm a trans woman but not on E or out to the doctors, constant deadnaming is mid but understandable

I'm queer and aromantic anyway, so I kinda hate it, but it's 07:15 am and it was a night shift,so I don't see her as much as when I was first admitted so it's fine otherwise | Yup! I was released for some reason like 3 hours ago and made another post about it lol.  *(Hangin might be a bit of bad wording lol)*, 

***I had a giant and horrifying panic attack when I saw my dad like 25 minutes before I was released so I don't know how they allowed it***

But I'm with my 2 best friends now and having fun lol | I get comfy socks atleast, lol

Her friends said they might come to her place later in the night, from a different party, which they eventually did. They met this old fling of one of my gf's friend there and they invited him and his friend (let's call him 'x') along with them to my gf's place.

I was the one who opened the door for them, woke up my gf and we sat together and played cards for a while.

It was getting late, around 4am, my gf said she feels sleepy and asked me to come to the bedroom with her and sleep. I wanted to have a smoke before going to the bed that day and went to the balcony to have my smoke. 

It would have been barely 5 mins and when I went back to the bedroom, I saw my gf and this guy x were making out and were undressing each other. I was so taken aback. I really didn't know what to do or how to do anything.

Just earlier that evening she was telling me that she was thinking about us getting married and the prospect of it.

I just left her house and went to mine at 4am and I couldn't even sleep. She called me later in the morning and asked why I left. I told her that you cheated on me openly and that's why. She is saying that we were all so drunk that night and she wasn't in control of what was happening and that was the reason and she is sorry for it. I can't take this as answer. Never

I feel the lack of taking responsibility even more disrespectful of me. I feel little and ashamed. I feel like I should not exist just to stop feeling like this. I have never even forced her to do anything if she didn't feel like doing it. But she goes on cheating and brushes it off. I had to attend a wedding today. But I have skipped it and don't have any energy to do shit. I am just lying on my bed since this incident.

u/SavageKev9,689,"babysitter raped me for 4 years Writing this here because bottling this up is killing me on the inside. The guilt and anxiety has been building for a decade and I just can't take it anymore.

My parents hired her when I was 10. I'd nearly burned the house down while home alone the month prior and they were too busy working to look after me themselves. My dad wanted a professional nanny but my mom insisted on hiring her childhood friend; I'll just call her Sarah. Sarah had just lost her job as a nurse and my mom wanted to help her get back on her feet.

I hated her immediately. Her hair was ratty, her breath smelled like fish and she seemed to think cheap perfume was a substitute for bathing. The first few months were fine but she quickly started pushing boundaries. It's weird to say but she'd treat me like one of her girl friends. She'd go on for hours about abusive ex boyfriends and childhood bullies and drunken one night stands, always making sure to swear me to secrecy afterwards.

My clubs and sports were my only time I got away from her but she convinced my parents that they were interfering with my grades and got me pulled out of them. After a year, my routine was coming straight home, hanging out with Sarah for 6 hours and going to sleep. I'm not going into detail but that's when the assaults began.

My grades immediately took a hit and so did my sleep. It all came to a head one day when I got a detention for falling asleep during a test. My dad was called in and after a few minutes of him questioning me about what was going on, I told him everything. That's the closest I ever saw him get to crying. When we got home, he and mom had an hour long screaming match where both blamed the other for 'letting this happen.' I was scared but also hopeful that it might finally be over.

However, the next night when I came home from school the energy had changed completely. Sarah was at the table along with both my parents and it looked like they'd been talking for some time. They told me to sit and asked if I had anything to say for myself. I asked what they meant and my mom said that Sarah had told her everything.

Apparently, Sarah had spent the day making me out to be some sort of sex obsessed pervert who'd been harassing and groping her for months. She had flipped every accusation I'd made back around on me and, infuriatingly, my parents had sided with her. I obviously denied all of it at first but after an hour and a half of my dad grilling me and picking my words apart I began to think it really was my fault. By the end of the conversation, I was tearfully apologizing to Sarah for my disgusting behavior and promising to never lie again.

The next day when I got home Sarah was there again. She made me say sorry for sharing 'our secret' and the assaults began again. It continued like that for another 3 years and this time I stopped trying to resist. Normally I'd spend my days brainstorming ways to avoid her but by then I'd figured there was nothing I could do. I developed a sort of helplessness that killed all my motivation and followed me long after she was gone.

I know it could have been worse but the ordeal really screwed up how I see things. I've been depressed, anxious and friendless ever since with no signs of it changing. I have mild pancreatitis from drinking and scars on my arms from self harm. When I try talking to my parents about it they just gaslight me. I've tried church, therapy and meds but nothing works. I just don't want to feel like this anymore.",u/SavageKev9,134,"They've put up with my mental issues for four years even after I dropped out of college.

Thanks so much! | Yeah, I've been trying to become more independent. It's just hard to hold down a job with all of my issues | Thanks for the support. | I'm literally crying right now. I haven't heard anything like that in years or maybe ever.

My mantra for so long has been 'what's wrong with me' because the authorities seemed to be angry and hostile to me no matter what I did. You were spot on about how telling other adults wouldn't work. I told a teacher and my parents shut that down quick.

As for therapy, she was sweet and very intelligent but she came from the behaviorist school of thought and had a real hatred for the cognitive behavioral approach. In English that meant that she *hated* talking about childhood trauma and wanted, instead, to focus on concrete actions to take in the future. That was helpful for a time- she helped me get my first real job- but without going deeper we eventually hit a wall. I have to sort out some insurance issues right now but then I'll look into finding a therapist that specializes in SA. | God, I hope they don't make me do that. If they decide to die on that hill then I'll be happy to go no contact but  deep down I just want a sincere apology. I know they're just doing mental gymnastics to avoid feeling guilt but the excuses will have to stop if we're ever going to rebuild our relationship. | It's crazy to me there are any happy people at all | Thanks so much for this. I've had this argument with my parents so many times that it's easier to just give up and accept what they say. I'm trying to get enough money to go back to university and if I do I'll make an effort to put myself out there more.

If you can't trust them it's hard to trust anyone. Good for you setting such firm boundaries. I hope I can do that some day. | I wasn't there but I've pieced a lot of it together over time. The day after I told my parents they both stayed home from work while I went to school. They then called Sarah over to question her or yell at her or both and she broke down in tears. When they asked what's wrong she gave them the story about me being the aggressor. One thing that really helped her case was my drawing notebook. It had pictures of pretty much everyone I'd ever met but she cherry picked the drawings of her to make it looked like I was obsessed with her. If I'd argued my case better I might've convinced my parents but I was 11 | I didn't emphasize it in the post but she was a very close family friend to my mom and really that whole side of the family. Sarah was on the verge of homelessness that entire stretch and my mom didn't want to push her over the edge. I know the logics not all there but that's why they did it. | Thank you so much for your kind words. I never thought people would be so supportive and it's really helped me get over the fear of talking about what happened. Hearing others say what I've been wondering for over a decade is just so validating. I hope my story wasn't too depressing for you all. I've been making progress in the past year and the suggestions on this sub have been amazing. If people in the real world were as kind as the ones here then it'd be a much better place | I don't know what they believe now. I can't bring it up without getting a ""I'm not talking about this"" or something similar. | Damn man I'm sorry this happened to you. The worst part for me is how no one believes you or cares. It's like family members are so ashamed of letting it happen that they decide it never happened at all. I hope despite all that, you can move past this. The worlds a tough place but we're tougher. | Thank you so much for the kindness. I was very scared to post my experience, but the response has been so supportive. I can't forget everything that happened, but it hurts less and less each day, thanks to people like you :) | You definitely have a point. There's a good chance I wouldn't be so messed up if it hadn't happened | To be honest, the real issue is my credibility. After 18, I went kind of crazy. Everyone said that my depression was just a phase, and so when high school came and went with no change I started acting out. Between the public intoxication and self-harm, my reputations pretty shot.

That said, I probably wouldn't have done any of that if it weren't for her, and the thought of her doing it again makes me sick. I'll definitely double-check the statute of limitations in my state and see if I can find any evidence that might help. Even if it isn't as smooth as I'd like, getting some justice for what happened definitely beats rotting at home | I've actually heard great things about the carnivore diet. I've wanted to try it for years but figured I wouldn't be able to stick to it.

u/SecretAccurate2323,137,"I am a worthless raped pig Story of my life is that im just a used cunt. Was raped as kid when a man close to my family decided to fuck me. Basically he just would tell people he was taking me places, but then get mad at me for random shit and fuck me. Things he punished me with rape for: getting sunburned, wandering off, letting my swimsuit top slip down, walking too slow, growing boobs, not finishing my food, not calling my mom to tell her where i was, not speaking to him in English, rejecting his kiss. He also would hold me down and let his friends have me. He rubbed oil on my nipples and took pictures of me splayed out. I remember him and his friend laughing together about how wet I was, saying that I liked it, and taking pictures of me to prove how much i liked it. When I started growing boobs he pinched them painfully and said I was a slut, and then laughed that my nipples got hard. I remember him sitting on my chest and forcing me to take his dick in my mouth. He also drugged me once and had me like that. He took pictures and videos of my body. 

As a teen I had relationships with older men where I would get emotional support from them and help and in exchange send them nudes and basically be their camgirl. I was so depressed at this time and would slash open my own vagina afterwards to punish myself. 

As an adult Ive been raped twice. One was so violent. He chocked me and beat me up and I got brain damage that I still struggle with.  Basically im a stupid fuck doll now too. 

The other rape was just some horny asshole. It still fucked me up though. Ive tried to kill myself a few times, but im too weak to go through with it. 

These rapes are the defining feature of my life. Im just a stupid used up cunt who deserves to die. I hate the sounds I made while being raped. I still remember listening to myself. I could not control myself and sometimes made little whimpers and squeeles when something hurt too much and i felt like my insides were ripping open. My rapist laughed at the sounds and said i liked it. I'm nothing. 

I won't make it through. Im not even pretty enough to be raped but it still happened. I deserve death. My mind and body is broken. I won't survive.

u/Secretquestions23,205,"15, Christian, caught watching porn, wanna kms On Friday night my parents caught me watching porn, and exactly like the title says I wanna kill myself. It‚Äôs an addiction I‚Äôve had for around a year, already kinda wanted to die because of it, after my parents caught me I tried to talk to them about it and tell them it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been struggling with, rather than trying to help/support me they just keep screaming at me for how I‚Äôm such an awful person now. I‚Äôm a fairly devoted Christian, that‚Äôs about the only thing stopping me from suicide. That‚Äôs why I already hated myself for watching porn and being addicted, it‚Äôs extremely against the Bible and I couldn‚Äôt quit. Don‚Äôt really know where I was going with this, just kinda ranting, sorry for making you read such a dumb post but yea I‚Äôm debating suicide and whether I‚Äôd rather give up my faith and kms or try to stick it out and figure out what to do

Edit: wanna clarify, my parents are not Christian‚Äôs. I am for reasons you all would probably call me an idiot for lol. But, I‚Äôm glad I posted, I‚Äôve realized I should quit worrying so much about what my parents (who have abused me my whole life) think, and that it might not be normal for your own parents to make you suicidal as often as my parents do",u/Secretquestions23,44,"I don‚Äôt believe my parents even are Christian‚Äôs, my dad I know isn‚Äôt he‚Äôs never claimed to be but my mom says she is, however based off the things she says to me everyday I can kinda make an assumption she might not be, I‚Äôm sure it sounds kinda dumb to you or anyone really who Hasn‚Äôt had this same experience as I‚Äôm about to tell you might not understand it, but the main thing that really pushed me to become a Christian is the fact that I used to love reading but I‚Äôm crosseyed and it‚Äôs gotten to the point I quite literally just can‚Äôt read a book anymore because I simply can‚Äôt focus my eyes on it‚Ä¶but somehow I manage to read my Bible 

I think your right, though, I think I just need to quit thinking so much into what my parents (who have always been kinda abusive, and I practically raised myself) are saying and more into what God says and what‚Äôs in the Bible, I know I‚Äôve sinned but He can forgive me and I need to figure out how to forgive myself | I had never heard of that before, I just googled it and it sounds just like what I‚Äôve been experiencing‚Ä¶I‚Äôve always had severe anxiety (like quite literally maxed out every test out there severe) and mild depression and that‚Äôs part of why all these things get to me too, I don‚Äôt have access to a therapist my parents practically call me an idiot anytime I‚Äôve mentioned therapy but I think it might be a good idea to look into that further | I think you might‚Äôve slightly misread (that‚Äôs not meant to sound rude, might be overthinking but in my brain it does when it‚Äôs not meant to) but my beliefs are basically the only thing stopping me from ending my life‚Ä¶it‚Äôs possible I mistyped too, I kinda just vented, I honestly just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore after their reaction they‚Äôve always been abusive and I‚Äôve practically been the only ‚Äúadult like‚Äù person in my life since I was under ten, basically raised myself, now all of a sudden this happens and I‚Äôm just a horrible person and no matter what I say it just keeps getting worse and worse until we‚Äôll as you read I just wanna die | I‚Äôve never been allowed any sort of privacy whatsoever, I literally get screamed at if I accidentally lock the door when I shower lol, but I have had a hard time trusting them to talk to because of things like this and they just freak out at that too, this time they keep telling me they don‚Äôt understand why I didn‚Äôt talk to them before if this was something I struggled with and then they go straight back to their screaming about how awful I am | If I‚Äôm being honest after reading some of these replies I‚Äôve realized every time I‚Äôve been suicidal in the past it‚Äôs had some direct link to my parents, it sounds bad to say but this time at first I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal and honestly I was almost glad they caught me, because it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve struggled with and I hoped they could kinda support me, but I‚Äôve been trying to give them space to think and they just keep constantly calling me out of my room to do nothing but scream and threaten to take everything they know is important to me, then I go try to sit back down and before I even have my door shut they‚Äôre back to screaming.

Last time before this I was suicidal a few months ago, it was my weight. I‚Äôm quite a bit underweight, but they kept telling me I eat too much (which before I started eating less was under one full meal a day) and calling me fat and by the end I quite literally almost killed myself with how little I ate and weighed

I‚Äôm not gonna keep rambling because this reply is already so long, but I think I‚Äôm starting to realize I might just need to quit listening to the things like this that my parents say, clearly they aren‚Äôt the best for me, I practically raised myself since I was around seven and I do literally everything maintaining our family/house if you get what I mean, I think I just shouldn‚Äôt let them get to me anymore (and I don‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt listen to them, just to quit letting these things bug me so much) | That‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been working on, I honestly don‚Äôt remember how I ever found it but since I was around twelve probably it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve struggled with and I‚Äôve been slowly getting better about it and I want to quit, I‚Äôve tried telling my parents that and that I‚Äôve been getting better in hopes for their support and instead well this post wound up being the result, but after reading all the replies here I‚Äôm really glad I did post, a lot of you guys have been really helpful and it‚Äôs nice to know I‚Äôm not alone, my parents have told enough lies about me I don‚Äôt have anyone in my entire extended family to talk to so it‚Äôs nice to know there are people here who care! | I really like your outlook on this, I‚Äôve been trying to quit but every time I relapsed then I just kinda felt like God would hate me for it, and then because I thought that I‚Äôd just keep relapsing for a while, but I don‚Äôt really know why I ever did think that, I read my Bible and I know he can forgive me so I need to quit thinking he wont | I know it‚Äôs bad, and I‚Äôve been trying to quit and I‚Äôve actually gotten quite a bit better, they just seem to care more about screaming at me for it than trying to help me like I asked them to, quite literally I can‚Äôt get them to say a word to me about anything besides this now and everytime they do nothing but scream, I know God can forgive me but now I need to figure out how to forgive myself, and how to get them to quit screaming lol | Thank you for those websites, I think that‚Äôs a good place for me to start, I need to forgive myself too. I‚Äôve been suicidal like this a few times in the past, and after posting this on starting to realize that every time it‚Äôs been something to do with my parents, last time it was all the things they said about my weight (I‚Äôm actually quite a bit underweight but they decided the opposite) and They said I ate too much (apparently half a meal to one meal a day is far too much) and I quite literally almost killed myself with how little I weighed and ate, but I‚Äôm realizing it might not be normal for my parents to make me debate suicide as often as I do‚Ä¶? | Yea kinda wish I could say it is | I‚Äôll be sure to look that up, thank you!! | I think that‚Äôs a good idea, rn I‚Äôve been trying to get my drivers license but last time I asked my parents to teach me to drive (I have my permit, I got it three months ago) my dad refused to speak to me for a week, and since my parents aren‚Äôt really Christian‚Äôs we don‚Äôt go to church but after I do get my license that‚Äôs something I want to do for reasons like this | Well honestly I guess I kinda only ever started thinking of it as an addiction because of my parents reactions and how they kinda freaked out, it‚Äôs never changed any part of my life really and I don‚Äôt think about it very often, but after they reacted the way they did I started to think a little worse about myself and it

I‚Äôve been suicidal in the past, a few times, never posted about it just kept it to myself (though I‚Äôm glad I finally did this time), but thinking about it now I‚Äôm realizing every time I have been it always has a direct link to my parents in some way-last time before this it was my weight, I‚Äôm actually a decent bit underweight and hardly eat at all (like literally 1/2-1 full meal a day typically is the most I can eat) but my whole family felt the need to comment everyday about how fat I am and how I eat too much, I just about killed myself not with a knife and not with a gun but with how little I ate and how little I weighed, even when I was at my lowest they kept on making comments, finally I quit listening but I just thought of it and yea I‚Äôm kinda realizing the fact that in some way my parents make me debate suicide as often as they do might not be normal‚Ä¶? | Thinking about it your right, the way my parents reacted I haven‚Äôt been able to get them to say anything besides screams about this for the past three days, but I shouldn‚Äôt let one bad reaction, especially from people who have abused me my whole life, basically destroy my life | I mean honestly the only reason I ever have been adult like is because I had no one else who was, I don‚Äôt necessarily want to be but when I basically have to raise myself and do everything myself I kinda had to be lol | Well one thing for a while I‚Äôve wanted to do is to go to culinary school, but we‚Äôll I‚Äôm a boy and my family has made very clear that is absolutely not ok (I also crochet, horrible I know lol I‚Äôve never liked hunting or fishing and I‚Äôve never heard the end of how awful I am for not liking those as a boy) and I also do really enjoy coding and art are both things I‚Äôve considered going into one day | Yea they kinda are, they‚Äôve always been physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive and every time I‚Äôve ever been suicidal it‚Äôs had a direct link to them, I think at this point I need to figure out how to just quit letting them bug me with these things | I just want to reply quick and let you know, I‚Äôm not ignoring you, quite honestly when I posted this I kinda just figured maybe one or two people would see it and instead I have almost a hundred fifty replies lol, and just about every single one is full of great advice like this one. I‚Äôve replied to a lot of them, but I haven‚Äôt quite replied to all of them and that‚Äôs mainly because those are the ones I‚Äôve really been thinking about (like this one) and I‚Äôve actually been researching some of the things in this one and I think they‚Äôre really good ideas, but quite honestly my brain is just thinking about too many things right now and I can‚Äôt quite process them all at once and figure out yet how I‚Äôm going to respond to each one-but I‚Äôm not ignoring you and I actually think it‚Äôs a really good idea lol | Well that‚Äôs about the right description of them, I have quite literally been screamed at in the past because I had a pimple on my face.

u/SendeschlussTV,133,"You know it‚Äôs over when thoughts of suicide have started to actually calm you down I‚Äôve thought about suicide for a long time now. Been suicidal for several years. I don‚Äôt know if there was a day in the last two years that I haven‚Äôt thought about suicide. The weird thing is, that when I first started getting badly suicidal, I was scared of it. I was afraid, I would hyperventilate thinking about it. I wanted to escape it. But over the time thoughts about suicide have started to actually calm me down, cause when Life is so bad it only makes sense. It‚Äôs the finale escape from all this suffering. I know now that I‚Äôm broken. I think my mind is lying to me when it tells me to hold onto hope and frankly so many people have died before me and will after me, so it‚Äôs not as scary as it seemed to be at first. 

When I fall asleep at night I think about killing myself, cause I‚Äôm starting to look forward to it. I wish life was different. I wish I never made the mistakes I made. I wish I could be happy and enjoy life, I wish life wasn‚Äôt so unfair but sadly I‚Äôm depressed, I made the mistakes I made, I can‚Äôt enjoy life and life is unfair and I also don‚Äôt think I can change my way of thinking. I think I‚Äôm broken, so suicide means freeing myself of this pain once and for all. 

I used to be so afraid of how my family would react to my death and I‚Äôm still scared that they will think I‚Äôm selfish for it but with time I really am starting to realise that it will be the best for them! I‚Äôm such a burden to them and I think they know that, even if they don‚Äôt want to admit it, but I am. So knowing I will relieve them of this burden that is me also makes me less scared and sad about suicide. 

So when it gets too unbearable (so almost always) thinking about suicide calms me down, sometimes I can even smile thinking about it, cause it will be the end of my mental pain. 
",u/SendeschlussTV,5,"I wish so too ): I wish we could all be happy. | I‚Äôm so sorry you went through this! Concerning your last question. You definitely should not do it in front of her, but I have to be honest that I can relate to the thought of it, because I too sometimes fantasise about killing myself in front of one of the people that caused my suffering to begin with. But I know it‚Äôs not the right thing to do even if that persons deserves it. | Hey thank you. I‚Äôm sorry u feel the same as me. Life is so unfair. It makes me so sad and angry at the same time! Why do some people get to enjoy their life‚Äôs so much while others suffer? Do I really wanna live in a world as unfair as this? I always think It would be good to talk to someone about it but I don‚Äôt think it will actually change the way I feel. I need to kill myself. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any other way and I really do believe it would be for the better for my family. Even if they are sad and cry about it for two years, afterwards they will be better off without me, they will realise that. It‚Äôs sad to think about it in a way but also good to know that I‚Äôm relieving them from the burden that I am. | Yeah my reasons for staying also used to be mostly based on others. Mostly my mom tbh. Nowadays I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs for the best. I‚Äôm the person causing my family the most trouble it seems. So I think they probably will be sad at first, ofc they will be, but maybe after some time they will realise how much easier life will be with me gone. 
Anyway I‚Äôm so sorry you are struggling too, I‚Äôm glad my post helped you. I wish you the very best | Oh yes I totally get the part about reminding oneself that everyone living right now will be dead in like 100 years or so anyway | I‚Äôve been to many different therapists and honestly I think for me they actually kinda created my problems to begin with but I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt try out therapy, I just think you gotta go into it with a certain mindset. | Oh gosh yes I feel this too. I‚Äôd say for me it‚Äôs more a weekly basis tho. I‚Äôll have a week or two where I don‚Äôt feel like ending it and then there a week of just wanting it to be over and those weeks get worse and worse each time. 
Sorry you feel similar ): Best wishes to you and your son | That‚Äôs so kind of you but I just feel so worthless. I keep pushing everyone in my life away cause I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve it, cause I feel worthless. I feel so damn worthless. Things happened to me and I just ever since that happened I feel broken and worthless and why would I deserve anyone listening to me, after what happened to me. I know I was just a kid, I should have been protected. There‚Äôs people to blame instead of me but I blame myself. Why couldn‚Äôt I have protected myself! I would be fine now but I was stupid. A stupid kid! I thought I was so mature back then but I was just a stupid kid and no one protected me from the evil of this world, but still I blame myself.

u/ShaiHallud24,106,"I'm afraid of NOT being suicidal Whenever I'm happy or on the rare occasions I feel a sense of hope about my life, I dial it down a bit. I'm scared of being afraid to die. I FEAR fearing death. When your suicidal, you feel like ""Fuck it, let's get it over with"". 

But when I'm happy, it's like ""Maybe I don't wanna die. Maybe I don't want this to end."" Then the anxiety kicks in and I'm overthinking about all the things that could kill me. 

I guess being suicidal is a comfort. It's like i've been sad for so long that I don't wanna be happy. I often downplay my achievements or happy moments in my life. I always think ""Yeah, I'm happy now but later something bad is gonna happen"" It's like I equate everything.

I'm going to cover my face with a thick jacket. When I cover my face with it, I run out of air. My breathing is already short, so when I cover my face with this jacket it will be the end. 

Idk how to begin my story, but I guess I should say that I love life, or better yet, I loved life. I loved one that was fulfilling, I went to casinos, I did cocaine, I drank until I past out on the spot. I've met so many people in my life; you couldn't imagine the amount of stories I've heard, seen, and felt. 

I came to the realisation that life, life is boring. There is no point to any of this. I came to the realisation that the point of life, is finding a point. There is no point, it's simply how bad you try to delude yourself that there is a point.

I'm going to end it all very soon so I dont mind saying my reasoning.

I hope reincarnation is real

When I tried it last time, there was buzzing that wouldn't leave me, but I tried pushing past that point. My whole idea or principle if you will, is that, if there is a higher power, and I end up in a long line, waiting to drink meng POS soup, then I've won. If I haven't, then I've also won, this is the end; even if I was wrong, I will still be ""alive', my body will be returned to the earth and the nutrients my ashes or body provides will supplement new life. In essence, I never really died.

You can think of the grass near my grave as me. I don't wish for a funeral but atleast give place my ashes beneath the soil. I don't want to be lying in an irn jn your living room. 

I love my family but spent too much time in my life being lazy, I read too many fantasy novels, and later on I dreamed too many dreams that couldn't exist within this realm.

My belief is that this isnt the end. My belief, is that once I pass out, I will be reborn and underworld and I will suffer for my sins, after suffering and serving my sentence, I will be given the choice to either drink meng Po's soup, or erase my memories. I will drink the soup and live the life that samsara has granted me

u/SuicidalWorthlesFuck,328,"M16. I am a fucking sick pervert that deserves to die. (Trigger Warning: Pedophilia)

This is a long and heavy one, but I need to get this out of my chest, and I believe I am ready, as I do not think even the best friend to confide in would tolerate this.

It started at 13 or 14 I think. I had unsupervised internet access. Up until that point I had discovered porn and enjoyed it and so I watched it. It wasn't anything, just vanilla stuff. That's when I dscovered at 13/14 the concept of Rule 34 and the site and porn comic parodies of my favorite shows.

My favorite shows were cartoons like Gravity Falls and Adventure Time. It sounds really weird, but I really enjoyed watching characters I knew and liked doing that. In hindsight, maybe it was due to my autism, which makes me find comfort in the familiar in all aspects, including this.

At that age, I didn't really know of the concept of pedophillia or ""loli"". I just watched characters I enjoyed doing weird stuff I did not understand.

I did start understanding, though, as I got older, but not in the good way. People online were taking advantage of me, I got caught up in ""rings"" and I lost all of my sense of self worth. To them, I wasn't a child. I was a slut and nothing more. I just needed to shut the fuck up and take it.

I am now currently out of this cycle of abuse, but a combination of my previous interest in cartoon porn and these experiences, well, I am afraid that they have turned me into one of them. Through 14 to 15 and a bit of 16 years old, I sunk deeper. I consumed the same porn, but with a different interest. That was not familiarity, but age. I got to the point of watching ""Powerpuff Girls"" porn among other IP's of that sort.

What changed at 16 is that I am aware of what I am doing now more than ever. I am 16 and I am attracted to preteen cartoon characters. What really makes me want to stop this is the fact that this is bleeding into reality as well, it is not just a fantasy anymore. Although I never have acted on it and obviously never will, I am starting to have these thoughts about real kids.

I think of what I went through and sometimes I pity myself, but right when that happens, I realize, I am still just a sick pedophile no matter what I have been through, and I deserve to die. This has exacerbated my depression and my self-hatred and, coincidentally, my suicidality.

I know I need help, but I also know that I do not deserve it. At therapy, I will weird them out. Worse, they will think I am a danger to kids and lock me up.

Really, this isn't me, or alternatively I do not want it to be. As much as I want to believe that this attraction is a separate entity that I can beat, that I can let out of my mind, that is not true. As I have repeated over and over again, I am a sick pervert and I deserve to die, and, really, I think I will.

Thank you for reading, I needed to get this off my chest. Quite frankly, I just want people to reassure me that I am not a monster, yet I know that I am one and that would only be a lie.

Goodbye, and thank you for reading.",u/SuicidalWorthlesFuck,7,"Thank you. I like writing. | I can't believe that it would be that simple, sorry. | I am unattractive, weird and dumb.

I only have a single friend and I am grateful for that, but I just want to put it out there that no one else would make the mistake of associating with me. | It is encoded deep into my morals not to hurt kids no matter how I feel.

Last night I slit my wrists and waited to bleed out but no matter what I did it just wasn‚Äôt enough. After I realised it didnt work and I need help I ended up phoning the emergency services who told me to just contact a crisis line, I did, and was on hold for over an hour before I gave up and went to sleep on my couch.

Woke up today, and went to work like nothing happened. There‚Äôs still blood and tissues all over my apartment and my arm is bandaged top to bottom. Every time I move it it hurts and is already bleeding through, but I have 5 hours left of my shift.

I wish I‚Äôd at least gone to a psych ward but for now I guess I just get up, eat, go to work, sleep, and repeat.

u/TheBroadwayCult,617,"I‚Äôm going to kill myself after I give birth I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (21M) for 2.5 years, and he has made it clear he wants kids from the beginning. I‚Äôm diagnosed with autism and was always pretty firm on not wanting kids, but he made me feel like we would be able to handle it together if we had kids, so slowly over time I came around to the idea.

A year and a half ago, I got pregnant but we were in a bad financial position, so I had an abortion early on. It was a mutual agreement, and I moved past it pretty easily, but he was really torn up about it. I told him when we‚Äôre able to bring a kid into the world, we would go through with it.

Since then I‚Äôm making a lot more money and he also has a job now. Back in January of this year, I found out I‚Äôm pregnant, and expected to deliver at the end of August. He was very excited and told me he wanted me to keep it, and although for the longest time I didn‚Äôt want kids, I genuinely saw a future with this man and thought having a kid together was a beautiful thing.

Sometime in the last two months, he has gone from being excited about the baby‚Äî sharing ultrasound pictures, wanting to make sure I‚Äôm drinking enough water and eating enough for me and the baby‚Äî to not wanting this kid at all. He told me he realized he‚Äôs not ready for kids, and he‚Äôs not willing to ‚Äúthrow his whole life away‚Äù for one kid. He realized he doesn‚Äôt want to give up his own personal freedom and playing video games all day/not having any major responsibilities. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, those are all reasons I didn‚Äôt want to have kids in the first place and I communicated that to him, but back in January, he talked me into changing my mind because I thought ‚ÄúI love this man, we can actually support this child now, and my love is so strong that I want to start a family‚Äù.

Now he‚Äôs giving me my options. We‚Äôre saving up for our own place, and my parents have money, so they let us stay at their house and we have our own bedroom and living room. They are EXTREMELY excited and supportive about a grandchild. I‚Äôm so grateful for them. But my bf says either he‚Äôs leaving once the baby is here and I have to be a single mom, we have to give the baby up for adoption and get kicked out by my parents, or to stage an accident to cause a late miscarriage and say it was a mistake. I‚Äôm pro choice but I‚Äôm 28 weeks pregnant, and he(the baby) moves around a lot, this is a real baby, nothing like the abortion I had at 6 weeks. I‚Äôm not a monster.

But I only changed my mind about kids because I thought we were going to do this together, he wanted it so bad. Now he‚Äôs completely flipped and talks about how unwanted this baby is for him and how he should have never convinced me to keep the pregnancy. I thought maybe he was just scared and he wasn‚Äôt good at showing it, but he‚Äôs made it clear he wants nothing to do with raising a child. Without a partner to co parent with, I would have never wanted this kid. I don‚Äôt want this kid to grow up with a regretful single mom or a dad who doesn‚Äôt want him.

My boyfriend says he loves me and wants nothing bad to happen to me, but I can‚Äôt raise a kid by myself. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm high functioning enough to do it without the other parent, but everyone tells me I‚Äôll be an amazing mother. But my baby deserves so much better than me. No one is going to want to date and marry an autistic single mom who‚Äôll never be able to drive. I thought I was super lucky with my boyfriend, and now I feel so blindsided.

Once my baby is born, I‚Äôm going to kill myself. My boyfriend can find someone to move in with, he‚Äôd have to anyway if he‚Äôs going to leave once the baby is here anyway. I‚Äôm saving up money and buying lots of baby items so it isn‚Äôt as big of a financial burden to my parents. My parents are amazing people and tell me I can live at home with the baby as long as I would like, so I feel comfort knowing they‚Äôll have my baby to remember me by, and my son will have such a loving household.

I can‚Äôt tell anyone this, so I came here to get this off my chest. I‚Äôm going to cherish the last two months I have with my boyfriend and my family. I never wanted to be a single mom, and I can‚Äôt bare to think about seeing my baby every day and him looking like my boyfriend, thinking how he‚Äôs gone back on his word hurts so bad. I would‚Äôve just had another abortion and looked into better birth control if he had realized he didn‚Äôt want kids back then. We could have been a happy childfree couple. I hope when my son is older, he‚Äôll understand. ",u/TheBroadwayCult,104,"I don‚Äôt unfortunately. I only have the support of my parents as long as I‚Äôm the one raising the kid, and I can‚Äôt imagine seeing them disappointed in me and disowning me. All they talk about is how excited they are for the baby. I was genuinely excited for the baby too until I found out my bf was backing out | His parents are not in his life at all, I‚Äôve met them a few times and they are not good people | tonight has been really hard on me mentally and i really needed to hear from someone who is autistic and a mother. thank you. | I definitely plan on that.

I never had a reason to keep going before, once I graduated high school, the real world became too much, so i had already been on a decline until i met him | Hearing from other autistic people has been helpful because you guys understand how much sudden change affects us. Like my brain can‚Äôt comprehend what I‚Äôm even going through, I feel like I‚Äôve been stuck in a meltdown for the last few weeks and I can‚Äôt escape or calm myself down. If I can make it through these feelings, your advice is honestly the route I would go down. | Abortion is highly illegal where I live, I was only able to do it the first time because I ordered a pill online. I would consider if it was accessible to me though | He told me he had been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting on what his future would look like, and he wasn‚Äôt ready to give up doing nothing all day because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs only 21‚Äù. He said almost word for word that he wanted to smoke and play video games all day and realized that no baby will make him want to give that up | I am. Getting out of that abusive relationship and having my son is probably one of the greatest things that‚Äôs ever happened to me. He‚Äôs 2 months old now and I am in so much love every day | Not really. Religion and the afterlife are weird topic for me where I don‚Äôt really know where I stand | They would kick me out, at the least. They have very traditional views when it comes to adoption and stuff like that, and they aren‚Äôt supportive of abortion or anything like that unless medically necessary. My mother runs the household and is also autistic (where I got mine from, haha) and she has very very black and white thinking | They don‚Äôt. I know they would kick him out asap (rightfully so) if they knew. But I‚Äôm holding out hope he‚Äôll stick around after the baby comes because he says he doesn‚Äôt want to lose me and loves me. I won‚Äôt have to go through with this if he‚Äôs here with me to help with the baby | If I was able to drive I would take myself. I know my boyfriend would be willing to drive me but it would be at least an overnight trip, and my parents would definitely find out. They are not pro choice | Yes I am! They are such a huge help and love spending time with my son. They‚Äôre such an amazing support system | unfortunately knowing myself, i really don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any advice i could give other than ‚Äúit‚Äôll work out‚Äù. the impending doom feeling is something i‚Äôve had since i was young and it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs ever gone away, not with therapy or medication. even in my happiest moments i have that ball of anxiety and dread in my stomach",1dfd9ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1dfd9ve/im_going_to_kill_myself_after_i_give_birth/,-0.99003005027771,-0.9964392781257629,-0.0064092278480529785,neutral
u/TheDoubleThe,228,"I HATE BEING TRANS SO MUCH And yet trying to be cis is worse. Being trans is just a ""fuck you"" to your entire life. Fuck your happiness. Fuck your ability to live a normal life. It's a curse you can't dispel. I want to get the fuck out. I'm tired of people being transphobic or seeing me as a novelty they want to stick their dick in. I want to be a normal fucking girl, but life doesn't let me. I'm gonna look up bridges closest to me and fucking do it.

Edit: The transphobes are at it again. I'm glad they're more concerned with the logistics of how being trans works and what makes someone trans rather than the fact that I wanna kill myself. It's almost like people like them add to it! Who coulda thunk!",u/TheDoubleThe,20,"2 sides of the same coin. We're both trans and despite the different individual struggles, a lot of it remains the same. Although I'm in a position where I am actively transitioning and supported, so I suppose we're not at the same stages. | I can admit it personally, my issue is I'm TERRIFIED of even the slightest amount of pain (scared to get laser, or even just my ears pierced), so suicide pain is scary | Living vs living happily unfortunately is a distinction | I have a supportive family and have been on HRT for 19 months.

I don‚Äôt care about making noise and fighting. I care about living my life, and being trans makes me unable to do that. I want to live for myself, not for some greater cause that I didn‚Äôt choose to be a part of. | Unfortunately I don't have the money for therapy, and every time I've done therapy before, I've left every session feeling worse. I don't think it really helps me. | The world gets nothing from one random trans bitch existing. | I don‚Äôt necessarily have all of that. I‚Äôm lucky to have a supportive family and friends, but the support doesn‚Äôt change my body or voice or anything so it doesn‚Äôt even help the awful dysphoria feeling | You don‚Äôt understand how being trans works because even if others mostly don‚Äôt, the ones that do fuck things up so much | Well it‚Äôll never be awesome then unfortunately. If people know I‚Äôm trans, it sucks | An unhappy life isn't a life worth living | Being trans isn‚Äôt a choice | I believe the solution is likely to get better understand and medical care of transitioning. Your belief on what it is is frankly pointless compared to the scientific studies saying it's not. Regardless, you can call it what you want. It doesn't change how I feel in the modern day. A big issue IS however the world being transphobic. | Being in trans community doesn‚Äôt really help. I am very different than how the trans community works. | Removing the label doesn‚Äôt make me pass | Yeah. They're both completely awful and suicide inducing, being trans is just like, still awful and suicide inducing, but not as bad and maybe sometimes I get a crumb of happiness as a treat. | A tale as old as time | I‚Äôm sorry to hear that Sonic the Hedgehog | I've been out for over 4 years. I've been on HRT for 19 months. I've worked on my voice almost every day, sometimes for hours, for at least half a year. I've been sent on a wild goose chase with that because no one knows how to deal with my voice because of how awful it is to work with. I'm trans because I hated being a boy and what comes with being a boy for almost all of my life, including my body. | I am not special. There's no ""especially me"" compared to other trans people. People close to me would be hurt if I died, but society doesn't care. I don't have a job; I don't bring anything to the world.

I also hate being part of a movement or something. I don't want to be an example of living your life, I don't want to be proof you can be who you want. I want to just be me. I want to just exist and be able to live my life.

Despite my post, the transphobes are the least of my worries, they're just what's happening in the current moment to me. Dysphoria and never getting to be and live as who I want to be is a MUCH MUCH bigger deal to making me want to kill myself. If I could pass, I could just stealth and have no one know I'm trans and thus never deal with that shit again. | I have a dream that involves my voice and apparently my voice is so fucked I might need vocal surgery and that surgery is far from consistent so I might just actually be screwed to never have a cis passing voice and thus I have to follow my dream never passing, which fucks things up | Passing | I've been trying for so long and everything gives me less and less hope in my future. | I didn't ""choose"" that I wasn't happy with my gender. It made me feel awful and suicidal and I figured out I was a girl. I didn't just wake up one day and be like ""hey yknow what lemme try this girl thing"".

I ALSO never said anyone forced me to be trans. It's not like someone at school made me trans (like some transphobes would want you to believe), but I also don't choose it because it's a natural feeling. 

Being cis and not trans is EVEN worse. Even if it WAS a choice, it doesn't matter because I lived as someone who was cis for 19 years and it sucked even more. You have no fucking clue what it means to be transgender. I'm glad that's your concern to someone being suicidal. | It's awful that is has to be that way, but like things being bad instead of awful is something to look forward to when you're trans. Sometimes the surgery is botched and sometimes even if successful it literally just doesn't change your voice in the right way. I'm 3k in the red every month and haven't had a job in over a year, so there's no way I can afford it, but I could probably get my parents to and pay them back in the future. I'm waiting on Canadian healthcare though so I \*still\* have 3 more months to figure out what the issue is to see if I'm just totally screwed, or surgery, or whatever. Bleh. | Ironically, I have gotten access to some health care I need and likely will have more in the future. HOWEVER there's so many things health care can't do SHIT about. That's the issue. If health care could fix it, then I'd be optimistic for the future instead. | Cause it's not a choice? I didn't choose to have gender dysphoria. I didn't choose to feel even worse as a boy. I didn't choose to be a girl, it's just a conclusion I reached after everything else felt worse. The scientific conclusion for treating gender dysphoria is to transition.

Like I said, you have no clue what it means to be transgender. I don't tell people I'm trans in my normal life;, I do label myself as female. Guess what? That doesn't magically make me look more feminine. It doesn't make me not have gender dysphoria. It doesn't make people believe me because it's obvious I'm trans and not a cis girl. I don't look like a girl no matter how hard I try. Trust me, I want nothing more than to pass and never have anyone know I'm trans. It's not that fucking simple.

You are literally doing the same thing people do with people with depression:

""I have depression."" ""Just be happy.""  
""I have gender dysphoria and hate being trans."" ""Just don't have a gender. Just don't tell people.""

You're telling me things like it's SO easy and like I've never thought of the extremely basic shit you're telling me. I'm not stupid.

If you're specifically talking about the transitioning part, like I chose to transition, then you're right, as that's the medically recommended thing to do, and the only thing that's given me crumbs of happiness. | A trans person being suicidal is not the place for ""teaching them why they're hated"" are you fucking dumb | If I had money, I would be doing many other health care things before even thinking about therapy. I've done it many times and it's sucked every time. I see no reason to try again. | I don't like being told I'm not alone cause all that tells me is ""Hey others hate being trans too!"" All that tells me is it's normal to wanna kms for being trans which isn't a good thing | I‚Äôve been out for like 3 1/2 years. I don‚Äôt tell people I‚Äôm trans anymore, or at least not saying I‚Äôm amab. If it comes up, I mention I‚Äôm like genderfluid from enby to girl and that changes day to day (which is 100% true) but imply that I‚Äôm AFAB. 

Passing is the issue though. I can tell people what I want but I can‚Äôt back it up with passing. My one dream in life would have a bunch of people seeing/hearing me so I kinda need to pass to achieve my dreams | I know | That's not how it works | Oh just make it work! Why didn't I think of that! 

I've put in effort to ""make it work"" every fucking day | I very much am just taking about normal as I‚Äôm not being trans. Which yes I know that being trans is still ‚Äú‚Äònormal‚Äù but it sure doesn‚Äôt feel normal and I hate it.

Ironically, I‚Äôm a very picky eater and don‚Äôt eat most foods people like, so I‚Äôm not normal with food and I‚Äôm self conscious about that.

I also don‚Äôt listen to music people normally listen to and can‚Äôt share my music tastes, and am self conscious about that.

I wish I was normal in those ways too but this was 100% just about my transness | Seeing cis women exist or hearing cis women talk literally ever triggers it",1h2m44a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1h2m44a/i_hate_being_trans_so_much/,-0.743206799030304,0.8649542331695557,1.6081610321998596,significant positive

u/TheIntolerable,226,"Why is it always assumed that the problems that cause people to be suicidal are always temporary? I tried posting this in the ""Too Afraid to Ask"" subreddit but it got removed. Everyone is familiar with the adage of suicide being ""a permanent solution to a temporary problem,"" but what if the issue  is perpetual and lifelong? There isn't a cure or remedy for every problem in existence. Isn't it possible that some people feel like they themselves are the issue, and not some temporary circumstance that will pass? Take me for example. I believe that my brain is so fundamentally flawed that I simply do not deserve to exist as I am. Some people are unfortunately inferior human beings and I am one of them. I strongly suspect that I have some form of neurodivergence that causes me to function ""differently"" from the norm.

But that's the thing. The way my brain is wired is what has plagued me for my entire life. I have very little common sense because of it. I have no social skills because of it. I'm not ""all there"" because of it. You would expect a brain with a ""different"" wiring to to at least have some strengths associated with it, but my performance is very poor to mediocre at best at everything I do.

He was 31 years old with two beautiful girls ages 6-8 and a partner who cared for him even though they both had their flaws.

Being a good partner and being a dad to our 4-year-old.

Being there for my brother's kids and partner.

Being there for my mom and my twin and sister.

Having to dealwith lawyers and coroner's and the police and the funeral home and trying to access his place to gather his belongings, the pound to get his dogs and explaining over and over and over again to people who are reaching out.

Cooking, cleaning, working.

I haven't slept much.

Everyone keeps needing something.

And I keep giving.

But I am tired.

My soul is tired.

I am hurt.

But what about my pain? What about my sufferings? What did I do to deserve all this? I still feel like I don't deserve happiness. What about the questions I don't have answers to?

I thought this was an automated response at first, but as someone right mentioned in this thread, the words ""The most effective and only ethical way to prevent suicide is to help decrease the suffering of the person who's thinking of suicide in the first place"" makes a lot of sense. | Well, I tried understanding from their pov. What I could come up with is they think we won't do it if they say that or they're simply expressing their feelings and thoughts.
But still I'd prefer them not to say those words because it feels like what we're going through is not valid. Somehow they're allowed to feel in such manner and express themselves by saying such things BUT we're not allowed to have such feelings. | I used to and still do think the same way sometimes. But I think it's because we don't tend to see the beauty in ourselves, we don't appreciate ourselves enough. Looking back I think we've all made it till here by fighting against our past events and making it through till here. I think we all might have crossed moments where we thought we wouldn't be able to make it past that situation. Seeing all the posts and responses I think I can say that in this sub I believe nobody's alone. Would you like to share or talk about anything? | It'd be a lie if I say no. The problem is when I'm at my lowest - when all the positive thoughts are blinded and only negative thoughts stick out. 
Of course, I understand that people will be in pain if I kms. But when I'm at my lowest I can't help but think about why I should be worrying over it since I wouldn't be able to witness it anyway. I know that's called being selfish but that's only when I'm at my lowest. | I hope so too.
I really don't like it when people I barely know or those who barely know me properly manage to make a negative impact on me. I hope we all get better soon somehow. | Life is unfair in so many ways. I hate it when life plays unfair games with me. I hoped to find the forfeit button and sometimes I was desperate for the forfeit button but here I am. | I feel bad for being sick too but I'm so used to it that I sometimes feel that I should feel ""sick"" because that's me and that's how I am. 
>""No one deserves to feel ""sick"".""

I know that too and I'm sick of hearing things like this because I know but I still can't help from feeling that way. | I also tend to have breakdowns that last for hours sometimes. It also happens frequently sometimes for weeks or even months and this has been happening for few years now. I thought it got better but I was wrong. At some point of time I considered sh and I even did it a few times which for some reason I found it silly so I don't share it. I don't know what apart from cutting would qualify as ""sh"" so I can't really say if I still sh or not. | I'm a loner. I looked forward to meeting new people and making friends and made efforts for the same which was tiring as I'm an introverted person. Yet, I turned out to be a loner. I like my own company. I like being alone but for some reason even though I like being ""alone"", ""lonely"" accompanies ""alone"" no matter what, I guess.
I do have my ""loved one"" but I can't help but feel guilty for still being like this and going through all of this. Sometimes I feel like I should leave my ""loved one"" because they deserve so much and I tend to break down in front of them because I can't always control my tears and also because I don't want bottle things up at least when I'm with them. I'm still trying though I don't have the answers or solutions to my questions or problems. I still try. Let's see where it goes.
I too wish there was a fool-proof way of putting an end to all this - more like disappearing from the world including from the memories of all those I've crossed my paths with. Too bad there isn't such a convenient way to do so. The fear of making it out alive and failing even in kms haunts me when I have such tendencies so I'm still here sometimes convincing myself that I can make it through because I'm still here. 
Let's hope we make it out of this by getting better. | >What makes you think you don't deserve happiness?
- the answer to this would be because I'm so used to feeling this way since years now so it has become a ""part"" of me. It feels like I'm still ""me"" when I have these feelings again. Hence I feel like I don't deserve happiness even if I find myself smiling unknowingly sometimes. I really don't know how to make it make sense to others like how I view and feel it. I don't know if others will believe me while I try conveying what feelings I feel when this happens.

>What makes you think you can find happiness too?
- maybe because happiness isn't an alien concept. I used to like making others happy (sort of regret it since I turned out to be people pleaser and now I am trying to get out of that without falling into trouble). I've felt it before. I've seen others feeling it. I see others feeling it. Genuine happiness. I know that because I know them - they're not strangers. | This is so reassuring to know :) you're doing a great job

I tried to convince myself that everything would get better, but it won't. I can see that now, I was born with no redeeming qualities, and it hurts  so much seeing everyone around me with friends, partners, being happy. I just can't keep telling myself that things will get better when I know it's not true.

u/Traditional_Exit8854,271,"My mom told me to kill myself in 2016, today I confronted her about it I was 17 in 2016, my mom was driving me home from cram school and we were having a pretty bad fight. She screamed at me to kill myself over and over again in the car while I was full on sobbing and hiccupping. I remember being scared of going to school the next day, worried that everybody will see my red eyes and tear stains from the day before and know what happened.

My mom has never apologized for this. Maybe I'm being petty, but that day I promised myself I would never apologize in turn to her about anything until she apologizes to me for what she said that day. I still adhere to this today. I want to say it's out of respect and solidarity to that poor kid in 2016 who shouldn't have had to hear that, but I know that's not entirely true and the real reason is that I've come to resent her a bit after that.

Fast forward to today, we had a pretty bad fight again. I brought up the incident from 2016, the first time ever I'm bringing this up. And you know what she said to me? She said I probably said something first to make her say that. When I pushed back on that, she said saying stuff like that is just a part of our culture (we're from a culture that believes in Confucianism) and that I'm lucky she didn't say it to me more like her parents or other parents she knows did. In fact, I'm mental for holding on to that for so long and not getting over it.

I'm not suicidal at the moment, so maybe this is the wrong sub to post this in, but I'm legitimately confused whether or not this is normal. There's a myriad of reasons why she makes me doubt the normalcy of everything (including myself), but that's too long for this post.

u/Vlcak,145,"My Nephew shot himself yesterday. I need some understanding and simply how to handle this horrific thing. He's 26, used a shot gun and shot his face. He's stable but will never be the same mentally and physically. He seemed so okay. Owned his own home, and car repair business. His new girlfriend may have been a big factor. He had just broke up with her the day before. His father passed away (maybe overdose 2 years ago and was an alcoholic). He dropped out of school after  getting into a good college because of drunk driving charges and pills. I'm not sure of those details but my sister was a cop and got him out of most everything like jail time or the cops reporting things somehow through nepotism.  He became sober- (had 5 years in AA), and had a sponcer and sponcered others. I'm devastated and so sad.

How do I best help now? Do I fly to NY before the funeral? Any suggestions are welcome. And thank you everyone for your kindness and support. | He finally passed last night. Everyone's hope was that he could donate his very healthy organs, I'm not sure if that's possible.
Thank you everyone here that did indeed give me insight to understand. I think I'm in shock. My family will never be the same. If you have family and friends and  AA sponcer and sponcees, a therapist and a roommate, it's diificult to understand how we missed recognizing his pain. I think the idea of tunnel vision was real for him and he saw no other way to deal with such pain. His note says don't blame his girlfriend, but that's dificult. What could she have said, done, to bring him to this??? I hate guns and have always but I don't blame the roommate for having one for shooting quail he said.

u/WaryPancreas,702,"My 8 year old wants to kill herself Last year she first told me she didn't want to be alive anymore. She was 7. I got her in with a great therapist who she still sees.

A month ago she did that phrase again. We made a safety plan at therapy. Two days later she threatened to bring a gun to school so I took her to the hospital for an evaluation. Cue us being held for 8 hours in the most dehumanizing experience only to be told not only did they have nowhere for her to go due to her age, but that her threats weren't credible anyways and we got sent home.

Tonight she got upset over something minor and completely went over the edge. Said she doesn't understand why she feels this way, why she has these thoughts. She wanted to kill herself although she didn't make specific threats. She then asked her sister to kill her. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm doing everything right...

It's a huge attachment wound. When me or her therapist ask what her biggest struggle is, it's always something to do with her dad, or the new family he made. She sometimes experiences bullying at school, and the school does a great job of dealing with each instance and keeping the kids apart. I have looked into new schools but I'm worried there will just be different asshole kids there who will also bully her, and maybe worse.

u/Wise-Importance3749,122,"I might be a zoophile(tw) English is not my first language sorry for possible mistakes. Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm (19f) a horrible person, this took a lot of courage to write up, my brain is foggy and I'm writing this while sobbing.

As you see from the title, I am a zoophile. I don't want this attraction, but it's the only thing that's in my head recently. My past horrible mistakes will kill me once. 

A little bit of lore 

It started in December. And it was only happening in December, I cut off everything afterwards because i realised I am a horrible person. Went into a spiral, even cut myself. I couldn't handle myself anymore. I don't really want to disclose in detail about what I did. But it was horrible and I wish I didn't do it. Though I want to say I didn't hurt an animal or anything. It's still eating me up from the inside and I can't find peace. 

There is days where I feel okay when I'm distracted by friends. But then I feel awful when I'm at home alone because all the thoughts come back. All the guilt and fear and shame comes back and I can't handle it anymore. I can't find a therapist near me that would be suitable. All of them are far away.. but I felt like I really needed to get this out of my system.

I feel like my thoughts are mostly intrusive, everything is a trigger though, I can't look at my dogs without feeling extremely guilty. I would never in my life hurt them and I don't feel an attraction towards them, I think. I can't imagine myself with an animal, I still feel an attraction to humans. All I feel is fear. I fear myself and feel like I have no control over myself. Anything I enjoyed before is gone, I can't enjoy anything anymore.. I can't focus on school. I used to be really happy up until the fact I was stupid enough to go to a man's house I didn't know well enough because I was desperate for affection. But I didn't like the way he treated me but couldn't say no and had nowhere to go so I had to sleepover at his house. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. 

I also never want to associate with the people that are sexually active with animals. I find it disgusting.

Hey, I'm a 17 year old HS student and a girl in my class who found me somewhat relatable due to my quiet nature, started venting to me about her life and issues.

I don't know what to do she just keeps talking about killing herself and nothing i say to her actually works. 

For context she's gotten numb after her therapist gave her anti-depressants (she's also 17) She said her dose was 100mg? Her family is messed up and from what she told me she's out of touch with reality, has issues with talking to anyone, fakes her smile and acts like a different person. She told me she often spends 3-5 hours max of her day just spending time in her mind?? Whatever she meant by that is up to your interpretation. She told me how she doesn't feel close to anyone or anything, her hobbies lost its meaning and her mother is an asshole who resents her own daughter.

 Can anyone please tell me what the fuck i am supposed to do? I know i sound like an asshole even typing this out but i am literally not qualified for this and i know i shouldn't even be involved with her dude.

u/anw3n12,218,"what is the point. nature is fucked and we are fucked. maybe I've seen too much gore, stayed too long on the internet. but either way I've realized, after seeing animals disembowel and eat eachother, humans tie eachother up set someone on fire, a child running into traffic and getting split in half, a woman's face get cut in half, a crocodile eat a dog and a man, rape, torture, murder, cannibalism- every single living thing is fucking vile and our inherent nature, our bodies meat and blood, its all just pain and death for the benefit of some other life. and then that life will die too, of disease or anything else.

there's no purpose. it really is just kill or be killed as much as we try to deny it. I don't want to live in a place like this. I don't want to eat anymore. I can't sleep. nightmares are getting worse and I'm afraid to leave my house. humans have created this false sense of safety when we are all just fucking animals and we're all going to die.",u/anw3n12,39,"it really feels like we're going backwards. | I really, really wish I could. for a small bit I thought like this, but again I got knocked down a billion pegs by the universe and I figured just my little measly self can't make a dent. history will repeat itself.

makes it easier to prepare myself for when I can't take it anymore.

edit: I also feel like I'm not allowed to avoid seeing the worst side of the world. there are people that have to live it and its selfish of me to just ignore it for my own ""sanity."" | I'm glad that you are able to change your mindset and see the good things.

I just can't no matter how hard I try and believe me I've tried. I think it's too late for me I shouldn't have posted here. I'm sorry. | the worst thing Ive done I will take to my grave. but I promise I'll forever self sabotage everything good in my life to make up for it. seriously its awful and just because I was hurting didn't give me the excuse.

the other bad stuff, I dont know how to list it all. I'm a person made out of mistakes. | you're probably right. I guess well a small example of something horrible I did, I think around 10-12 years old, was that while my parents were fighting or when my mom would have her freak outs I'd flood the ant hills outside my house. crush pill bugs. think about offing my own mother, watch and read horrible things. I just had so much anger but its no excuse. i stopped going to school, I pushed all my friends away. 

turning from 15-to now 20 years old, it clicked how absolutely horrid I was, still think I am even when I avoid hurting anyone, anything at all costs. I push people away now because I'm terrified of saying something mean by accident. I just want to be reborn as someone naturally kind and innocent. | I dont remember a lot. I feel like it wasnt that bad, or like it was all a dream. I was never physically harmed, unless you count the occasional gut punch from a sibling but that's normal. I have vague memories of laying awake at night and hearing her throwing things, swearing in the bathroom.

I mentioned how my old friend's mom was nice once, and she got very upset and mad. that fight ended with her begging at my feet to hug her and tell her I loved her. when I didn't she bashed her head against my desk chair and made me hug her and say it. 

came home late once and she forced me to sit in silence with her, when I didn't my brother grabbed my wrists and made me. threatened police too, said I was crazy for shaving my head, made me cry and humiliated me at school. she commented on my appearance, said everyone thinks your fat, don't eat that, covered child me in hair remover when I went through puberty that one haunts me eugh. oh she kept getting my dog sick giving him food he's allergic to. still does that once every 6 months. currently she's better than before, doesn't do a lot if that anymore. she's focused on her own issues and I have to watch her get yelled at by my dad everyday which he yells a lot and its giving me anxiety despite him saying he doesn't yell. he is nice though I love him. my mom and me though, fought over so many things yet I cant remember why for most of them.

sheesh that's long im really sorry. | yes absolutely it does like I'm kinda speechless. I didn't know the right words for it, but my parents definitely have to be emotionally abusive codependent. my dad always talked about divorcing her but he never did, never does. and she completely and utterly goes insane at the mere thought of him doing that, of us leaving. definitely because of the even worse abuse she faced from her own mother, and her childhood being actually a nightmare from what I've heard. 

I feel like in her attempts to keep me close, a codependent, she did the opposite. I dont hug her, I dont like hugs at all actually. though I want one all the time. but I guess she did make me afraid of everything enough to where I cant leave this freaking house. setting the narrative that this is normal, she most definitely did because after everything, every single conflict the next day, or even an hour later, she acts like nothing, NOTHING happened, even asking me if I want to watch TV or eat dinner with her. I hate that. I hate she still pretends. I asked her recently if she remembers threatening to kill my pet fish over something stupid and she didn't remember at all. just said ""oh my god I dont remember did I do that? I'm a horrible mother i should die.""

but yes everything you've said sounds right, and thank you, because I feel like I have a better understanding now. | if i sat her down, asked her why did you treat me like that you made me feel confused and frustrated and utterly miserable, while simultaneously making me think I had to have done something wrong for her to act that way- she would most likely reply with something along the lines of harming herself. or even take the car and drive off.

I think I did ask her after a breakdown once but I blocked out her sobbing, I can't remember what she said but it made me feel incredibly guilty and scared. I've definitely accepted all the blame, I always tell myself it's my fault, for quite literally everything. I'm an idiot, im worthless, unlovable and hideous. I gave up on myself, dropped out, and now I live at home, watching my parents fight while thinking about every way I could kill myself. I probably do need therapy, if I could just get past the fear of people, the fact that I think everyone sees me the way I see myself. everyone is better than me and nobody likes me, im not worth anyone's time.

I want to believe I can change this, be the parent I wanted to myself, but the self hatred runs so deep i dont see myself as a person. I'm that annoying pebble stuck in your shoe, or a hangnail that keeps coming back. but I really wanted a good childhood, I beg to whatever is out there to let me go back, somehow fix it all. maybe its why I like childish things now, I still own plushies and watch kid shows, still mentally feel like a child. trying to recreate what I missed.

I wish I could have made a great and bright impact on the world. The reason I am probably so hesitant is that my life has barely begun. I'm twenty years old. If I gave myself twenty to thirty years, I could probably gauge my impact, figure out what is wrong and strive for something better for everyone. I wish everyone felt that way to some degree. Though, some people are afraid of opening Pandora's box and don't realize they're actually in it.

**Update (10/04/24)** :

I missed my ticket.¬† A few days ago, I tried to die and woke up the next morning with the most excruciating migraine and bodily weakness of my life. I still feel a bit weak. I see where I messed up a step and why I lived.¬† As of now, I'm on the margins of figuring out what to do next. Even though¬†mind is in a weird place, I do know that I'd like to thank and hug everyone who felt moved by my note. 

It is fact there is endless and boundless suffering in life. I am so sorry you cannot escape your undeserved agony, and I have my deepest compassion for your trying. You do not deserve this in the first place. For those whose suffering is more than they are capable of enduring, and whose challenges are practically insurmountable, I send you the¬†highest¬†and brightest peace, self-love and courage and my respect for your autonomy to make the best possible choice for yourself. To those who choose to pursue living, I eagerly support you to continue! I know it is hard. This cycle of inner struggle‚Äîspiraling, self-doubt, bitterness, frustration, delusion‚Äîis baked into our humanity, and we may never fully step out of that cycle until our last breath. But you know what? While we are alive, I rejoice in the days, moments, minutes, and seconds to spare you aren't caught in that cycle and feel connected with and free.

I purposely didn't elaborate what pushed me to suicide in my note, because this note isn't about me; it is about you. Whether you sobbed, felt your stomach drop in fear, or clenched your fists in self-frustration, I dream you confront what your subconscious yearns for and achieve it. 

If I may include, this world *is* unbelievably fucking awful and cruel and full of suffering. I cannot dress up that undeniable truth in pretty words and still keep my integrity.

¬†Knowing this‚Äînearly dying‚ÄîI realize there are things I wanted to do. I wanted to make the world a better place. I wanted to make people smile, to make people laugh. I wanted to lower people's guards and help them feel joy again. I wanted to ease people's stress and invite laughter. I wanted to help people open their Pandora's box and show them there is still merit in staying in this world despite the horrors. I wanted every interaction I have to be raw, energetic, vulnerable, and alive, so that no one ever felt warranted to question my intentions; instead, they remember the humanity flowing in their veins. I wanted to wake up every morning and feel self-confident from sunrise to sunset, knowing that this is the gift I would deliver to you personally, and I would do it again and again and again. 

...Now, despite that..

 ..I am just as much as hesitant to live as I was to die. Even though I feel in tune with my life's purpose, the lack of noise in death fulfills a large part of me that life cannot. If I had given myself another twenty-five to thirty years, I could have departed on my deathbed with my head held high and spine erect. But that isn't now. Frankly, a part of me wishes it were. I type this in hopes that maybe it will resonate with someone out there, and know that you aren't alone in feeling this way.¬†

Thank you for reading this. Have a good day, everyone.¬†‚ô°",u/blue-wisteria,25,"I'm glad it resonated in your heart. Since it moved you, I hope that's a sign you have a whole lot of connecting and love you have the potential to give. And we definitely need more of it. I do not encourage anyone to suicide.

I want for you the strength and support that will aid you overcoming your challenges these upcoming months, years, and life. ‚ô° | Thank you for encouraging me to think deeply. I agree twenty is horrifically young, and that young people in general are hasty. I'm aware that with sufficient time and growth, immense suffering can become a tool for becoming a better person in some way. Like an unexpected groundedness for the trials that life inevitably will bring, whether we deserve them or not, like you said. I know we (and most of all living things) are hardwired to need struggle to grow, thrive, and succeed. But in all honesty, these past two decades and childhood were a lot of suffering, pain, and trauma and I'm exhausted finding and flailing for more tools and systemic support to help me stay afloat. 

For loving support, I am very, very lucky but father, sister, and friends can only do so much. The burden to save my life should be on my shoulders, not my friends and family. If I were dying against my will, I'd understand the moral imperative to save me but they cannot feasibly save my whole life. | I don't normally write with this eloquent prose, haha.

From past experience, I say, ""Sleep on it, wake up the next day, and give it time,"" instead of making rash decisions.   
  
Around this time last year, I had spinal infusion surgery . My back was a wreck. I remember saying I wanted to go home right after surgery. I was in agony. What pushed things over the edge was that it took a long time to figure out what was wrong, along with the insurance games. (I don't know if I got this right?) Then, finally, the surgery.  
  
By then, I was at my wit's end. The pain after surgery made it even worse.

Anyhow, I kept wanting to go home. I was supposed to stay in the hospital for a few days, and then supposed to go home. Complications made my stay longer. As soon as I woke up from surgery, the pain was intense, and those complications pushed me over the edge.   
  
On the flip side, those same complications kept me in the hospital.

If I had gone home, I‚Äôm 100 percent sure I would have ended my life. No question about it. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone because I was dead-set on it, which is why I wanted to leave so badly.   
  
Because of the complications, I had to stay. The pain subsided, and most of the issues got resolved. Fortunately, there was no literal way to end my life there. My bed even had an alarm because of the fall risk after surgery.

That stay, though it sucked, saved my life. It was a blessing.

Things improved with my spine over time too.

Two days ago, an employee asked me about the pain after surgery and back pain. I said to him him, ‚ÄúYou know, the only reason I‚Äôm not dead is because I had to stay. Otherwise, I couldn‚Äôt have cared less about business or anything else.‚Äù The pain had tuned everything else out. Yes, I have a lot to live for, but pain can drive a person to that dark place and quick. 

Hence the reason I now say, ""Give it time. Don‚Äôt make rash decisions.""

Prior to that surgery, I didn‚Äôt care. I was rash. Now, I had never really been bitten by that way of thinking either. I mean, I got mad at my boss in 2016, left a six-figure job with union benefits, and said, ""See ya."" Even in business decisions, I‚Äôd been impulsive.   
  
That surgery on September 22, 2023, changed my ways, and I'm more patient now too.

If you're feeling down, remember: ""No rash decisions."" Give it time. It‚Äôs normal to need time to sort things out.

This reads like my dad. It made me smile :) I hope I did this justice. Again, thank you for sharing. | Ah, this made me giggle. Kamisama Kiss is also my favorite shoujo manga! You have great taste!

I have faith in your autonomy and I hope this isn't too intrusive to say‚Äîplease seek other resources that are mandated by a hospital or health organization. I'm not familiar with the country you are from or what is available to you, but I implore you to do that research first. At least in the U.S and Canada I'm aware there's resources that will help you if you are concerned about your dignity. Please, please do not trust what people sell online. People have been arrested for selling those kits. It is one thing to provide methods and resources on methods as a source of information but it is another to make a kit with instructions and materials and profit from it. For your safety, please do not continue down that rabbit hole. I beg. | I relied on the support and strength from my family and friends many, many times. When I say survival is own my responsibility, I meant there are things that are literally out of my loved one's hands and which is my responsibility. 

Is my aging and retiring father (who doesn't own his own place) supposed to house me and provide me financial support to establish safe independence when he can barely afford to rent a one-bedroom? Is my sister supposed to heal my trauma and help me do my activities of daily living until I am lively enough to do it for myself and forgo her education? Are my friends supposed to come with me to my hypothetical workplace and intervene when I'm completely overwhelmed? 

Like how a therapist can talk and hear me out, though does nothing for the systematic/political/economical/situational issues I come back to outside their office that neither the therapist or I can control. I am not just taking responsibility for the product that is my mental illness, but addressing the above issues that leave me this choice in the first place despite how insanely difficult it is. It's hard, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone. | Thank you. I apologize, it wasn't my intention to undermine your words. I'll try to believe in the part of me that people see. Really, thank you! ‚ô° | Truthfully, I'm unsure if I'll even be here a week or a month from now. Faith and hope are precious treasures from anyone, and I‚Äôd hate to have been rude and insensitive in dismissing yours in my first reply. I don't know if I can be that strong, but still, I appreciate you. ‚ô° | I've looked for resources. I really, really tried. The fact that I am not the first to experience, nor the last, is heartbreaking but I empathize. I am so sorry you feel this pain. Thank you for being gracious and patient with me. | I'm sorry, I was conflicted how I should answer, it made me happy!

I hope you have a bright and wonderful day ‚ô° | You're more than enough too. Thank you for your kindness. I'm trying really hard to do my best and not forsake it's worth.

u/bobblead,162,"i hate being black so many races out there and i got unlucky :/ i really hate my life, i'll never get these years back and i'll always be stuck in this family with this life forever. i will never ever be white no matter what so i've really been feeding myself a ton of false hope. just feel so unhappy these days",u/bobblead,7,"i will never have a white childhood or a white family or have experiences with white people because everyone in my area when i was younger would tell their kids not to hang out with me because black people always fight and are dangerous. i hate everything about myself and if i were born as any other race, not only white, i would be happier and more confident and feel more human. i don't feel human i feel worthless and like an alien especially since my parents pretty much wanted me to get bullied by giving me an alien type name that nobody can pronounce. maybe if i were white i would have an easy simple normal name too but pretty much i hate my life and i didn't choose to be black. i hate everything about it | mainly because it is out of my control and i didn't choose it. 


some people will assume i'm aggressive, loud and ghetto and treat me accordingly. others will assume i'm ""trying to be oppressed"" and that being black is actually great and i'm just looking for a reason to complain. if i were born white or any other race, none of that would happen. remember that this was not my choice at all. nobody wants to be unhappy, i have tried my entire life to appreciate my skin and culture but i still feel very unhappy and disconnected to it. 


i feel like everyone is just judging me all the time and wants me to die. and i feel like both left-wing and right-wing people hate black people and think we're all miscreants. but if i were born as any other race, which could have happened, i wouldn't have to feel like a burden both economically and socially and i wouldn't live in my shitty family because i'd have a white family instead. i would just be happier and feel validated more and not always seen as a bad person. 


currently, i pretty much allow anyone who's white to walk over me because i would rather they make my life hell than i make them uncomfortable and maybe even confirm what they assume about me (that black people have a short fuse and are violet and commit crimes and we're scary and threatening and we aren't really human: try, apes, monkies or gorrilas). i always assume at the back of my mind that white people are always right and they belong and own this earth and country i'm just a subhuman who should be grateful to even be alive. i feel worthless compared to every other race, not only white people. seems like black is the most hated race with the worst stereotypes. 


i don't want to make this post last forever but i feel like the only thing stopping people from still hanging us and shit is just the law and fear of prison. i think innately, people feel fear or threatened by us and that makes me feel very miserable all the time. nobody sees us as human so nobody can sympathize with us. i can't even do anything about it and i can't physically change my race, it's not possible and especially in the summer as my skin is getting darker. i feel miserable all the time. i really wish i could be white - it's not fair that some of the things i have gone through that i twist and turn about at night wouldn't have happened if i wasn't black. im not implying white people or other races don't suffer, i'm talking about the conext of the personal things i have gone through. nobody would choose to be miserable, remember that. nobody who is sane would choose to be miserable, anything i am sad about is something that i have tried and tried to not hate myself over and see the good thing in. but when all the copes and all are used up, the reality is that i am still black and everyone still hates me either because i am pretending to be oppressed or because i'm a ghetto ruffian who loves committing crimes. so i still hate myself and nothing will fix that, even if i magically became white today, i will never get a white childhood and i'd still be stuck in this family and i'd have my experiences that still make me miserable. | keep assuming im trolling because you don't believe someone can be unhappy in their body.",1c0zg9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1c0zg9e/i_hate_being_black/,-0.9918177127838135,0.7801983952522278,1.7720161080360413,significant positive

u/bulbasaurlesbian420,137,"Ending it two nights from now Exactly what the title says. I (23 f/nb) can't do this anymore. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for almost 20 years and it's never gotten better. I finally have the courage to act on them.

From infancy until fourteen and a half I was sexually abused. My birth mother was involved in two different child sex/porn rings (or a big one? or one and then independently pimped me? Idk. We moved and it didn't stop, but at this point that detail isn't super relevant) until I was eight. I'd probably had over one hundred sexual partners at that point. When I was three, I caught an STD from her boyfriend and my grandmother took me to the hospital from the resulting UTI. I went septic. I know I should feel lucky to be alive but I wish I had died. My grandfather and uncle also started using me sometime before I was five, which is why it didn't stop when I stopped living with her. My grandmother was the only semi-decent person in my family and when she had a severe stroke, leaving her a shell of her former self, when I was 11. I lost any semblance of family I had left at that point.

I had enough when I was around fourteen and snitched to a guidance counselor, who got me put in foster care. Nothing super horrible happened there, but the damage my birth family inflicted had been done. I was professionally diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder at 15 and was a problem child due to my traumas and inability to deal with them. At one point I was put in a group home to work on trauma focused CBT and I completed the therapy, but it hasn't helped. I've been in therapy for over a decade (my bio family was threatened with my removal by the school if they didn't, but I didn't think I could tell the first therapist what was happening) and I'm still the same mess I was when I was getting abused. I was on meds, but thanks to the memory aspect of my illness, I'll either forget them or forget to refill them, thus making the concept of medication useless. I've been in psych wards and group homes so many times, and I always feel like I come back worse.

I'm turning 24 this year and none of it is getting better. The only reason I'm not dead yet is that I have two cats who need me. On top of the DID, I'm a severely depressed, anxious, and probably psychotic alcoholic who keeps reliving their worst moments on repeat. I'm scared of everyone and everything. I have nothing to live for except my two cats (they deserve better than my mess). I have a fast food job where I like the people, but I work in a small-ish space where people are constantly bumping into me, which is a huge trigger. I can't fathom how bad things will be during the busy season. I can't help but think I squandered any chance of a good life I had by going into foster care and letting my trauma/mental illness take over my life (my abusive grandfather had a college fund and big dreams set up for me and now I'm nothing). 

The only thing I've ever been good for is being useful to others, and my best friend is in a financial bind. I get paid tonight. If I buy a hotel room for Thursday and the supplies to end everything, I could send him the rest of the money, help him out of the hole of bills he's in. He's told me before that he'd take my cats if something happened to me (think like, jail. There was a period where that was a possibility, but I've verified it would apply in this situation, too, although at the end of that conversation, he threatened to try and commit me to the psych ward again if I kept talking that way so he like. Cares.), so they'd be safe. Obviously this isn't just about helping out my friend, though. The fact I'd be more useful to him dead than alive is just a bonus.

The real reason I want to die is because being trapped in the body that everything happened to and forced to relive it is torture. I can't sleep because of it (either nightmares or some nights, every position I try to fall asleep in reminds me of a position I was abused in), can't shower or bathe regularly (same thing), can't let people touch me without proper warning, etc, etc. Every day I'm not working I feel stuck in my bed or the couch, trapped with only alcohol or drugs to bring me any peace. There's so much fear and sadness in me. I don't have a quality of life and I dread having to deal with this for another three or four decades. I deserve to end things on my terms, to be able to end my misery. The first time I tried to kill myself I was five years old, so I think that's long enough to know what I want, to know I have no hope of getting better. Some of us (DID alters) are so scared of dying, especially of the methods I've picked (they're painful and gruesome, but if I combine methods, I'll up my chances of success. I can't afford to fail if I do this) but most of us are more scared of staying alive to suffer.",u/bulbasaurlesbian420,14,"I haven't heard of it. I'll have to look into it.

u/cracked_armor,105,"""He didn't show any signs"" I really dislike this kind of statement. The person ""showed no signs."" There are always signs.

I am by no means saying anybody, who missed the signs in somebody they lost by their own hand, could have done anything other than what they did. That is part of the problem I am trying to communicate.

I think about suicide a lot. A LOT. Method. Manner. Motive. I often wonder if today is going to be the day. Not so far. :/

When we say somebody ""showed no signs"", we are letting people off the hook. Not you, dear reader. If you lost somebody this way, you are a victim as I see it. There are always signs.

The problem is, they are taught not to show the signs. Long sleeves in summer. A razor blade tucked away in the desk. Crying alone in their room. Somewhere along the way, the person was taught they needed to hide the signs. It might have been a parent, a teacher, a bully, a friend, a grandfather, or just a misinterpreted scene in a movie. For me it was my mother. 

There is no chance to debrief, to contextualize, or to vent. I can't even say I necessarily blame whoever it was who taught them this lesson. I am sure they didn't even realize what they did. I tried to talk to my mom about the thoughts I had. She absolutely flipped out. Angry at me, the elementry school kid who realized life isn't actually worth living. It made an impression.

I am still here because I am a coward. Please don't contradict me on this with platitudes of ""no it actually means you are strong/brave/etc"". No, I assure you. Cowardice. The same feeling that kept me from riding roller coasters. The same feeling I get when I didn't want to jump off a cliff into the lake even after I watched my friends do it and turn out fine. Cowardice. The inability to face my fear in pursuit of something I want.

But to function, I can't show it. The few friends I have left would abandon me if I talked about suicide as often as I thought about it. Countless 'friends' have abandoned me. I couldn't hold a job if I came to work with visible, fresh cuts. I would be medicalized in the horrifying American health care system being a broke shlub.

So I hide it.",u/cracked_armor,1,"Replace ""some"" with ""universally"" and I 100% agree. | I wish I could say talking about it helps. It doesn't. It never has. I don't know why.

You are certainly right about this: I feel trapped. I feel like so much of my life is up to the whims of other people. I have to do things because they make sense to do, not because I want to do them.

I want to shake my manager like a Victorian child and tell her that when she meses around with other people's mental health, she can kill them. Then I realize what would come of that. It is far too risky for me in every sense for no benefit. Still, I want to. She has a kid with adhd. I know what that is like. I know how that can turn into a depressive cycle. I want to shout at her that is she mucks around with somebody's mental health without knowing what she is doing, she can be the catalyst of their death.

Nope. It would be very stupid to do, she would not thank me for the warning. Powerless.

I have finally been able to hold a job because a pandemic forced employers to let people work from home. This improvement has a huge luck component. Some skill, too. If one has the mind for development, developers are often remote workers. Not everyone does though. I had parents who taught me how to use a dictionary and encyclopedia before Google was a thing. I am genuinely surprised to find out how rare that is, even today.

I have, at best, a small influence on my life and the choices i have to make. | Heroin overdose available on request. | That we try to accommodate each other instead of locking out people who don't fit into the greater society.

Reform the legal system so that legal the quality of legal representation is not determined by the tax bracket of the parties involved. 

Stop publishing features and quasi-documentary videos that stress how ""out of nowhere"" somebody's suicide or drug addiction or shooting spree come from. ""There were no signs"" is almost code for ""I didn't notice the signs"". 

Make basic psychiatric services available to everyone.

But the suicide injections on request seem more practical. | I would consider basic psychiatric services as easy and affordable assessment, diagnosis and (at the very least) some medication, even if it isn't the latest and greatest. Even if it is the cheapest, most basic.

Psychotherapy, while effective for people with short term depression I am sure, has done nothing for me. My brain is faulty - I may have incredible capacity for imagination and learning (as I am often told) but it is also isolating and does not seem to respond to the normal positive feedbacks other people respond to. Whether this is congenital biology or learned behavior is a question we won't know the answer to for many, many years. However one this is definitely certain: I consider suicide less regularly with medication.

Chat/Text hotlines do nothing for me. I have tried them, they are a waste of time. Most of my therapists don't even remember what I say from one session to the next. I had one I told I found everything boring and would likely zone out in our session if she said the same thing over and over again. Then she did that and expressed incredulity that I could possibly be bored after suggesting to ""get some sunshine"" and ""be in the moment"" for the 100 billionth time.

Psychology is a very young field, most people in general don't really believe it is a problem the way cancer or heart disease is a problem. By extension, most companies and governments don't want to provide such services partly because the people who make them up don't actually believe it and it is difficult to bean count the return on investment.",1cdln4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cdln4s/he_didnt_show_any_signs/,-0.999468982219696,-0.9393414855003357,0.06012749671936035,neutral

u/emaciatedalone,123,"I encountered a rude nurse! The last time I attempted suicide I had to stay in a ward for 2 nights. I needed 3 drips, the first one was 1 hour long, the second was 4, the third was 16. But I was in there for a good 4 hours before being treated.

One of the nurses that was treating me had been giving my dirty looks the entire time. I only had a shirt on because I needed the drip so my arms were exposed, I just assumed she was disgusted by my arms or something. In between drips the nurse would come into the bed bey I was in and take blood. 

I caused a struggle for them every time because I have a really bad fear of needles, I have never gotten any vaccinations and any needles I have gotten I've been sedated for-- (or have been a toddler) so I understand that she would be annoyed but the 2nd time I got my blood taken, another nurse was holding me still while the original nurse took my blood.

u/fangirl0203,264,"I'll be gone in 30 hours  I am 14f, a student in Korea. (South Korea, for the unfortunate ones who think internet exists in NK) I did make a post here before, but I deleted it because I felt a little paranoid about my mom going through my phone. 
 (By the way, this is going to be super long, so unless you have nothing to do, please use your time to help someone else.) 
 To put it simply, I'm under a lot of stress to go to a good university. And for that I need to go to a good high school. And for that, every single impression I make on teachers and test matters. 
 And even if that weren't the case, I can't just 'take it easy' like my therapist suggests. Any time I'm not studying, like now, I feel like I'm falling behind and soon it's going to be too late. 
 I've been feeling this way sometime since the pandemic. (Not because of it, just a rough timeline) I kept telling myself it would get better somehow, but it just kept getting worse and worse. 
 Recently my mom found out about my self harm. She dragged me to a mental hospital, and I actually felt a little hopeful that things would take a turn for the better. But now I just feel like neither of them actually care about WHY I feel like this. They just want to drug me up with antidepressants so I can keep pushing through. (I don't think my mom knows how to help me. She is severely depressed herself) 
 As for my dad, I'm fairly certain he doesn't know about the self harm, just that my mom used his card to pay for the mental hospital. He doesn't seem to believe in mental health, because he keeps insisting ""she's just going through puberty and stuff"". Now he's getting tired of my 'whining'. 
 Anyway, my finals are on the day after tomorrow. And because my mental state has severely deteriorated the past few weeks, I have barely studied for it. Even if I didn't have to take the finals though, I just can't see things getting better for the next 4, 5 years. 
 I just can't do this anymore. I don't WANT to do this anymore, because it's not worth it. 
 I'm tired of going to school 5 times a day and pretending like nothing is wrong. I don't want to see my 'friend' who is technically sexually harassing me. I don't want to study study study anymore, and I'm tired of my parents who think I can just 'snap out of depression'.
 So in  roughly 30 hours at midnight (10pm for NYC) I'm going to jump off my balcony on the 29th floor. The reason I'm making this post is because the kind people who tried to help after my first post deserve an explanation as to why I stopped replying. 
 I feel so so sorry to my 2 friends at school, all of you who tried to help, my parents who probably tried their best. 
 For the next 30 hours, I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want for the first time since... 4th grade, maybe?

Today's the day, and tonight's the night. I don't really have anything planned for today really, just do the chores my parents gave me, proofread my letter one more time, and just pass the time with video games and YouTube until tonight. I've already scouted out where I want to do it. Not at my house since I don't want to scar my family any more than what they're already gonna be from this. I plan on doing it at my local park. It's got a big field way on the outskirts of it. Peaceful, with a good view of the stars too. I plan on waiting until everyone goes to sleep tonight, take my last shower at about 10 pm, and write 2 more on-paper notes. One for my family to find in my room, telling them to call the police and telling them the location of my body, and one on my body telling the police that my suicide letter is on my phone in my notes app. I'll walk to the park somewhere between 12 - 3 am and just look at the stars for a while. Might drink a little too, play some music. Once I've said my prayers and my last words, turn my gun onto myself, pull the trigger, and see what happens from there. These past few days have been strangely peaceful actually. Feels like I've got control of my life for once and that I actually know what's gonna happen.

I'd like to thank everybody who left comments or sent me pms after my last post. All of you are amazing people and you will hopefully go on to do great things with your lives. Thank you for giving some comfort in my final days. üñ§

u/gaxeho6107,134,"My closest friend just committed suicide We haven't known each other for long, but he was the type of friend I really connected with. In the last year I found him really annoying due to his constant lying and self pity. He was selfish and narcissistic, which led me to believe that he wouldn't kill himself. I know now that was a lie on my part.

I didn't want to deal with him and have constantly postponed having a hard talk with him. I have never regretted anything as much as I regret this.

I saw him a couple of days before, and we talked candidly and openly about a lot of personal thoughts. It was a good talk but I wasn't as good of a listener. I lacked empathy and understanding. If I wasn't so full of myself, I could have gotten him to open up more, we could have gone through all his troubles. I'm convinced that if I did that he would be alive today.

I know he was planning this for a long time, the issues he had stretched from before our friendship. But the problems weren't his issues. The problems were that he was alone. He had friends and family but no one he could open up to, no one who could understand him. I could have, I just didn't bother.

He was a better friend to me than I was to him. He was a very empathetic person, and I will miss him a lot. The worst part is it took him dying for me to realize this. I know that if he told me that he was considering this, I would have said everything I should have. But it shouldn't have been his responsibility. I love him and I miss him and I am so sorry.",u/gaxeho6107,-2,"Everyone cared about him and everyone told him that. Everyone wanted him to get better, nobody was pressuring him be be someone his not.

There were friends of his who didn't even know he was depressed. 

He was an adult out of school and without a job. He refused to seek any help.

My regret is not pushing him enough to talk to me about his issues. | He called himself a narcissist. Part of the things we last talked about was him concincing me that he doesn't want a psychologist to change who he is beacause he likes himself.

It was self pity. He would fail at something and then complain how hes a bad person who didnt deserve anything. I'm not saying this is bad or pathetic, it just is.

I listen to him without judgment. The problem wasn't listening it was not asking enought. He never opened up to me about his suicidal thoughts.

What I want is a human expresion. A personal story or thought of someone who went through something similar. I want to see how people go through this. | What makes you think that? | Empty platitudes do nothing. People want genuine empathy. I appreciate the the response, but this usually makes things worse. | I'm not sure, only his parents know the details and I didn't want to ask. From the circumstances I belive he jump from somewhere. | Where, exactly? | I think people here got the wrong idea. There was no talk about suicide or any other personel issues. Only abstract references to some situations in his life. I was aware that he was feeling down and that there things that were troubling him. The reason I knew is because he was constantly lying to me about events in his life. I could tell he was hiding something from me.

I wanted to confront about all the lies, but kept postponing it. In my mind it was a hard talk and would probably achieve nothing. This was me convincing myself of a lie.

He only vaguely referenced his issues and never talked about them directly. I never pushed them to do so. That was my mistake.

To make myself very clear. I don't think it's my fault he killed himself. I never dismissed anything he told me. It WAS his responsibility to get help. He wasn't alone. He convinced himself he was alone. I could have maybe convince him otherwise, if I tried.

A lot has changed since I made this post. I had talks with his friend group and I finally understood him.

Just like all of you here, he was building a world in his head that was so unlivable the only reasonable thing was to kill himself. That's why you're all here. You're convincing each that the world is shit and there's nothing worth living for. Collecting courage for the final act.

Change is hard and it takes a lot of effort. For most of you, the effort seems insurmountable.

For him to change, he would have had to open up and be vulnerable to a very inhospitable and unforgiving world. That was too hard for him. Easier to convince yourself there is no point.

I could have held his hand. I just didn't bother. | I'm guessing it has to do with my responses in the comments. I would've liked clarification. | How do you know its better? | I can imagine places worse than Earth. Why don't you believe those exist, who says you can't hate more? 

At the end of the day, this is all rationalization: ""If this is the worst place, then it only makes sense to leave"". Right?

My friend was a 40-year-old jobless, wifeless loser. He grew up as everyone else surpassed him in life. That made him feel worthless. He thought he was dealt a bad deck in life, and that was somewhat true.

And yet all of his friends and family members miss him, in the end nobody was really judging him. The image he was trying to build for himself was something nobody really cared about. The self-pity cycle destroyed him and isolated him and nobody knew what to do.

He had enough to make him happy. His misery was completely self-made. But it doesn't make it any less real. That was my mistake.

The circumstances around people's lives are real.

I do believe i have ocd, i think it formed entirely last year after severe trauma stuff :( 

I do feel if i talk to anyone about this they will have the same reactions. When topics of furries and also zoophiles (theyre different) comes up, my family, coworkers, friends all have the same reactions. That zoophiles and pedophiles arent people and should go and die and stay out their life or other things. My sibling has bluntly said they think all zoophiles should kill themself no mater what because theyre disgusting. I wish i did have people to go to irl it would help so so much |  I have seen many posts from pedophiles, zoophiles and more that are actually into it and have extreme guilt. Mostly here or tumblr or twitter, just stuff from over my years online. But I don't think many want to be like this, shunned from societies left and right for something we cannot control. But the more confident ones make it seem that we all accept this which makes me feel alone

 but still thank thank thank you so much for your kind words. I will always keep ocd in my mind if it is the answer, but for now I do not believe so | Thank you for the support its giving me confidence to maybe try that route. I will continue to debate on it, but im still blegh. I hope he can refer me to a specialist or support group | Its so confusing because i do like the idea of human and animal sex, or animal sex in general. I dont want to go much into it sorry. But I have heavy intrusive thoughts and they've all just made me terrified of things, like stairs, children, glass, walking past trucks, toothpicks, feces, ect.

Im not asking for more therapy talk of course, I just want to explain that it feels like a very clear line inbetween a fetish vs an intrusive thought. But regardless, I will actually look more into what you said and maybe i can use it as a starter to talk to my therapist. | I didnt know those existed??? I will try and look into it thank you so much | That is what i have been looking for but i have little to no luck.

I don't know though. I wish you the best in life | What is the difference sorry | I haven't actually but id be willing to give that a try | I finally had therapy today and my therapist doesn't think I have ocd because I don't have compulsions.

So weird coincidence you're checking in on me a few minutes after i stopped myself from doing it.

But I've had many people still message me here saying nice things and its been comforting. | WHAT | I will give that a try thank you | I am üòê | "" Is this your only sexual orientation or do you also have other sexual tendencies?""
This! Sorry i don't know english to well either | Thank you, i talked to some friends + sibling, and they elaborated a whole bunch o what OCD actually is and uh yeah. I uh yeah its z!ocd. Apparently people don't ruin their whole life because of a paraphilia or fetish. I was wrong. Im gonna take some time to try and bring it up to mt therapist again, but I think I will try for a new one since he's very dismissive of the whole ocd thing.

I don't reallt know how to bring it up in therapy its just scary yk? Any ideas on how to start the convo would be great | Its specific animals and then humans as well. I think humans are great | He wouldn't explain what complusions were and gave examples like ""well i have to count to three before leaving a room"". I just found out that be rereading research papers for hours almost everyday about this and trying to find ways to be a good person is apparently complusions. Ontop other things. So. Oof. He was very adamant that i need complusions to have OCD

I genuinely don't know if i could compare this conversation to any other difficult ones I've had to do :( all of them are hard and scary but telling someone in real life? That makes me want to kill myself because of every possibility that could happen. But im going to try. Sometime. I don't know how to start the conversation or even what to do incase he tries to say i don't have OCD again | Thank you again, sorry ive been busy with work and this subject won't leave my mind so ive been stressed. But best case scenario he just doesn't say anything that might show he doesn't believe me, is very respectful, and says he can help me with a plan to work with this or a specialis

I I did not know z ocd and ocd were different-ish, and i think you said smth of it. I did some more reading on it, thank you i see the differences in it. I hope he knows how to help. Worst case is he tells me because i dont have phsyical complusions i cannot have ocd in any form. Again. I don't know. Im just scared he will tell me ""well it doesnt sound like ocd of any form. But being a zoophile doesnt mean you're bad"" which will send me to spiral again. | Yeah i know I'm just really scared right now and im rethinking of the session and picking up on red flags I missed. Im gonna ask in r therapist or ocd and ask if these are red flags or not. I'm bouncing back and forth on if hes even safe yk.

u/indierock24,928,"Switching From Passively Suicidal to Actively Suicidal Actually Gave Me Relief? *Has anyone else had this feeling? Or find it somewhat relatable?*

I \[24M\] have been passively suicidal for a few months now, but yesterday was an exceptionally awful day. I slept super late, I forgot I was scheduled to work, couldn't get dressed, couldn't leave the house, tried to fix my bike but ended up breaking it even more. Then I gave into pretty much all of my self-sabotaging vices (drugs, porn, shitty food, video games, you name it). 

  
I swear something snapped. I cried a *ridiculous* amount throughout the day and spent the rest of the night feverishly reading up on suicide. I actually figured out my gameplan. I found a whole document outlining the specifics and answered all the little questions I had (sorry not sharing ‚Äî don't even ask me) plus a backup option in case I'm desperate enough to do something quicker. For now, I'm in the stage of acquiring the materials and getting my affairs in order.

  
Since I got my suicide method figured out, I'm in a strangely upbeat mood. 

It's an odd paradox. Finalizing my plan of action to end my life made me feel motivated to go out and live it. I'm getting chores done with no sweat, I'm dancing and listening to fun music, I'm gaining bits of my personality back. A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

From what I heard, it's common for people to act calm or joyful the days before they make an attempt. Is that what I'm experiencing? Maybe it's because I have a goal now? Like my days don't feel meaningless like they persistently have? Or maybe finally there's an escape route to break free from the shitshow that is my life. I don't feel as trapped and hopeless anymore. 

Anyways, I wanted to see if this anyone here had a similar experience or wants to weigh in on this situation.

TL:DR - I'm actively suicidal for the first time in my life and I feel much better after I figured out my method. What's the meaning behind this?



 ",u/indierock24,76,"I think you're right. My life has gotten so off the rails and I lost that feeling of agency a very long time ago.

u/maybeDysmorphia,367,"Why *shouldn't* I kill myself? Genuine question. I am autistic. I just don't understand.

My belief is that humans have an innate instinct to want other humans to survive (in a protecting the tribe sort of sense) but other than that, I can't see any logical reason why some people seem to care. It's my body, why shouldn't I die? I don't like living soooo, why not?

I feel like I'm crazy and no one could ever understand. I'm like an alien wearing human skin. The way my mind operates is so different to a normal human that the advice people give just doesn't work for me.

I feel lonely even though I'm surrounded by people all the time. 

Related to the second to last paragraph, I talked to my therapist and brought up a time when i was younger when a girl flashed me in class. It was something I found quite traumatic but people laughed at me and called me gay for reacting poorly. It's been a horrible reoccuring memory for years and something that makes my skin crawl every time I think of it. I've always been upset at how fucking pathetic I am and how any other boy would have been happy, how there is something wrong with me.

My therapist pointed out that if you reversed the genders it would result in police action and I was shocked. I've never really thought of it that way. It changed my perspective a lot. I'm sorta rambling right now so idk if this is very coherent sorry. | I've been trying to work up the courage to actually reply to this for more than a day but I keep getting distressed and deleting the whole thing. Even now I can't stop my hands from being all shakey god I am such a baby.

Thank you for your words. I can't make myself believe you regarding your anecdote and I can't make myself explain why without wanting to throw up but I appreciate the attempt at least. 

Ive heard so many people say the exact opposite. All popular media says the same. I just... It's just politeness. I'm not angry at anyone but myself but I know reality can't be changed. I could write thousands of words but I can't because thinking about it makes my will to live reach zero.

I think I'm just broken and something is fundamentally wrong with me. I don't think I could explain and at the risk of (unfortunately) sounding passive aggressive, I don't think you would really understand. Maybe. I really don't want to misjudge people or belittle their experiences. I would feel horrible.

Anyway enough of that.

Thank you. Sincerely. | No and trying to tell me I'm not when I've already stated that is so incredibly toxic it's not funny. Do you have any idea how invalidating it is to try speak my mind and then have dozens of people simply REFUSE TO BELIEVE I CAN ACTUALLY BE A MAN? I hate that gender roles are so defined that the moment I express any emotion or weakness so called ""progressive"" people start declaring that I simply MUST be a girl. | Thank you for listening to me. I really appreciate people taking me seriously.

I was 14 at the time so it wasn't super immoral or anything, the part that made it so traumatic for me was how my body reacted. It was around when I first started going to the gym and I was in the peak of my puberty and I remember being so horny I felt light headed. I remember every muscle in my body being so rigid I got a cramp in my neck and had shooting pain in my jaw. It's not something ive ever talked about for obvious reasons and its something I can only talk about with online anonymity, but it was so intensely disturbing.

I've always been upset with the existence of my sexuality and how it impacts others. I don't want to treat other people like objects of desire and I feel intensely uncomfortable with that sort of thing in general. I don't like how my hormones make me crave intimacy and it scares me that others feel this way too. 

The worst part (and something that makes me want to cry) Is the only examples I can find online of people experiencing this sort of thing are from HORRIBLE evil people using it as an excuse ""I can't control myself"" type of way which is AWFUL. I'm horrified and It feels so unfair that I am like this.

He got really drunk today afternoon at home and when he gets really drunk he tends to talk weird stuff but never before about suicide until today.
He started talking like he wants to kill himself, he's not good enough for me and I married him because I pitted him. I was trying to get something out of him that would tell me more.
He told me he feels like that for a long time by now.. even before we met each other, that he wanted to kill himself when he turns like 30yo maximum until he met me. He had really hard life so I get it. 

Then he was talking about ending his suffering with suicide and he won't feel anything anymore and he wouldn't care about me and family cause he will be dead and won't feel a shit..

Gladly our friend called and told him that he got a great job for my husband that he wanted so he got him out of it a bit. When they finished the call it seemed like he got better, he was calling with friend from Korea and I thought it's gonna be fine now. I gave him a bit of space cause he wouldn't do anything to himself while calling with his friend. When he finished the call he told me they were talking about him wanting to kill himself tonight while I'm sleeping.

He was talking about how he loves me so much and wants to be with me but on the other hand he wants to end suffering for me and others and before we met I was smiling and stuff and now I have depression and social anxiety. And that I'll forget about him and find someone better than him.

He even attempted a suicide today, wanted to kill himself with a gillette, gladly as he was drunk he mistook the side of the gillette. I didn't know about it until he told me because I had no idea he would actually do something like this.

In the end I talked him out of it, not even sure how anymore and I put him to sleep. I don't want to sleep because I'm worried about him and don't want to tell our friends about it cause they're our together friends.

I'm worried that he may try it again soon even though he said he's not going to. 

And yes.. I was thinking about calling ambulance and taking him to the hospital but in our situation it would ruin us both and he wouldn't forgive me ever.

Did someone go through something similar with their loved one and can give me some tips how to act around him and make him not do it? I'm pretty desperate and need to talk about it with someone.

Thank you in advance.",u/miyauwu69,10,"Thank you so much for your reply, means a lot to me.

I'll for sure read the book.

I was telling him something similar to what you wrote. That I would never leave him and want to spend the rest of our life together and stuff like that. That's probably how I got him out of it. | Thank you so much. 
I'll try to talk to him again in the morning and use the tips u gave me + something I found on the internet. 

I tell him I love him and that he means the world to me every single day. I know most of his past but it took me a lot of time to get it out of him too. I kinda knew that he was hiding something but didn't know that it's suicidal thoughts. 
He does a lot at home and I'm thankful cause I had a hard time with my health issues past months, he helped me in my worst and I want to do the same for him. We are stuck at home together for almost a year now. He fucked up his shoulder at work and is home for year and half now and after 2 operations. My health issues didn't help much either and I know that it's hard for people around me especially him and he must feel desperate about not being able to help me. It's a lot of stuff on me too. 

I'll try to discuss some psychoterapy with him, I'm going myself and it helps me a lot.

u/myriad00,768,"I jumped in front of a subway train a month ago I'm still alive. I'm missing a leg and went into a coma for three weeks. It can truly always get worse, never think otherwise.

Not sure why I'm posting this. Just want to tell people to be careful with how they choose to unalive. The permanent damage isn't worth it.

Proof since some people think I'm lying, don't mind the dirty laptop:

https://pasteboard.co/ZKxvaCwo70PB.jpg",u/myriad00,296,"I had my spleen removed, left leg degloved and amputated below the knee, fractured femur and fractured left arm, 100+ sutures and staples along my left side where the impact was. Also fractured my skull, suffered mild brain trauma and had plastic surgery, I look pretty okay all things considered and it's genuinely a miracle I didn't end up a quadriplegic, vegetable or brain dead in some way, but fuck this sucks. Sitting here hoping my insurance covers a prosthetic leg is stressful as fuck.

High fatality rate apparently doesn't mean shit in my case. | Thank you | Thank you for the kind words | I don't. The only reason why is fear of damaging my body even more. I personally wish the attempt succeeded, and really it should have. | I still kinda wish it did. Now my life is a whole lot worse than it was. Yeah my family knew but I only have two sisters left that I speak to and we've been pretty distant the last year or so, so they didn't know how bad it actually was. | The last thing I remember from the day is texting my ex something but getting interrupted by a bunch of people from my house calling me to tell me not to do it. They then threatened to call the police so I drank the rest of the bottle I had and blacked out.

When I woke up I was restrained to the bed by my wrists because I kept trying to take my ventilator off, I thought it was 2005 when the nurses asked. I was literally convinced it was 20 years ago. When I originally woke up it felt like the opening scene from 28 Days Later or The Walking Dead, it was early in the morning in the ICU and there were no nurses around so I thought I was reborn in another life and abandoned in a hospital or something. It was really crazy. My memories were completely shot for the first few days I was awake, I had to have my sister visit for my memories to flood back. It's almost two weeks now and my memories are almost completely back, I'm missing a few bits and pieces though and short term memory is hard. Consequences of the mild brain trauma I was told, so not much I can do but hope it gets better | No idea. I got struck right before it slowed down and fell onto the tracks and underneath the train itself. I'm just gonna chalk it up to me being insanely (un)lucky for all the wrong things. I don't remember exactly how I committed the act because I was blackout drunk and have no recollection of it whatsoever. | To be honest, not really. I'm just in a pick-up-the-pieces mindset. I need to secure an income through my workplace for the medical absence and find a place to live once I re-learn how to walk in rehab. The next few months are going to be rough. | 24 | Alcohol. I went past the point of no return on a bench in the subway, blacked out and here I am. I also chose to do it at off-peak hours, the subway station was almost completely empty. I'm sure a couple people saw it unfortunately though | Do you want me to send a timestamped picture of my stump? I've been awake in the hospital for just over a week and have had time to wake up, recover, and process it. | Not that I have anything to prove, but 

[https://pasteboard.co/ZKxvaCwo70PB.jpg](https://pasteboard.co/ZKxvaCwo70PB.jpg) | I don't have nightmares, but when I was in the induced coma I had awful nightmares that were associated with the missing leg and hospital setting. They also felt like they lasted actual days. It was pretty bizarre.

I'm sorry to hear about your leg. I guess our running days are over, but there's worse things. I have wicked bad phantom pain right now where it feels like my foot is being crushed. At this point I can only find it impressive how resilient and resistant to dying humans are | Most of my family are dead and don't speak to me anymore, I was in the process of losing my job, my landlady told me to get out within one day and I had $50 left to my name. I could have called somebody or made a better decision but add severe mental illness (depression, GAD, bipolar) to the mix and it wasn't looking good at all. I was unmedicated and just didn't care. 

When I was about to do it I was sitting next to the bridge I originally planned on jumping off of and drinking a 26 ounce bottle of vodka I had while watching subway trains pass by underneath the bridge, so then I got the idea to go into the nearby subway station and jump in front of one.

Thank you <3 | You‚Äôre right. I tend to be the ‚Äúclass clown‚Äù of groups of people, so I know this is true. It‚Äôs so easy to make other people smile and laugh, but so fucking hard to do it for yourself. It‚Äôs kinda ridiculous. 

I ended up going to bed safely and now I‚Äôm awake the next day. I‚Äôm ok, and I‚Äôm gonna be ok for now. Thanks for responding <3 | Omg I am so proud of you! I dropped out of college and haven‚Äôt figured out what I want to do with my life‚Ä¶ which is crazy because I‚Äôm not THAT young anymore lol. I have a few ideas of things I want to do going forward but idk if they‚Äôre good ideas. 

Congratulations on graduating!!! And thank you so much for your comment <3 I often wonder why I‚Äôm going through the pain I go through, but then I consider that maybe it‚Äôs so my experiences can help others one day (when I‚Äôm less vulnerable myself and able to help). 

Thank you <3 | I‚Äôm safe! I woke up today at around 9:00 something, but I just laid around for a few hours half asleep. It‚Äôs 11:00 now but I also deleted some emails before coming here - haven‚Äôt been just a sleepy lump all morning lol

Thank you for caring <3 | You‚Äôre 10000% right. It really just gets extra hard when the sun goes down. It‚Äôs morning now and I feel a little better. Not perfect, but better than last night by far. I don‚Äôt want to die, I was just scared and confused. I felt like there was shadows, or like black mist, and it just was consuming me. Metaphorically speaking. I couldn‚Äôt see my way out and needed someone else to just TELL me to get out. It really helped seeing all these comments. I feel beyond overwhelmed with love and appreciation. 

Thank you so much <3 | Hot chocolate is a great idea. It‚Äôs morning now but I might do that anyways. I also promised someone else here that I‚Äôd take a shower, so I‚Äôll do both of these things. Shower and cocoa! 

You‚Äôre all so good to me <3 thank you so much. I am overflowing with appreciation | This is the second comment about hot chocolate, so I guess I have no choice! <3 lol

Thank you for caring. I feel indebted to you all. | I stayed home, I went to bed safely. It‚Äôs morning now and I‚Äôm ok. Thank you for caring <3 | I feel better yes, thank you! I am not at my peak but I‚Äôm definitely not in the horrible place from before. I even brushed my teeth lol. Thank you so much for taking time to comment here <3 I appreciate it so much | Fuck. Thank you. 

I really do feel like I take up time and space. Like I‚Äôm an annoying, ugly living room lamp that nobody likes but you can‚Äôt get rid of. I mean, I really don‚Äôt have EVIDENCE of this, but I still feel it. I try to make everyone as happy as I can, but then I often feel so burnt out from it. I‚Äôm trying to prioritize myself more, but that‚Äôs so hard too. Ugh. Nothing is ever easy. 

I went to bed last night and woke up ok! I didn‚Äôt touch the pills or anything. I‚Äôm ok now. I‚Äôm not like, the best I‚Äôve ever been, but I‚Äôm not going to die. I‚Äôm going to drink some hot cocoa, take a shower, and then see where it goes from there. I‚Äôll be ok.

Thank you so much for your comment. Everyone here has helped me more than they know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trying to respond to everyone but there‚Äôs SO many notifications coming in. I appreciate it more than you know. I feel overwhelmed with this care for me. <3 | I did! I‚Äôm ok now (it‚Äôs morning). Thank you <3 | Thank you, you don‚Äôt know what it means to me. I‚Äôm ok now (it‚Äôs morning) and I brushed my teeth. That‚Äôs already a step ahead of my expectations of myself. <3 thank you | Thank you!! I definitely felt the good vibes, I am doing better now in the morning! I woke up and laid around for a bit, then brushed my teeth and washed my face. It‚Äôs not much but it was more than I usually would expect from myself. So I blame the good vibes for giving me the energy I needed <3 you and the effort you put towards me means more to me than you know. | I wish I had the words to express my appreciation for your comment <3 and everyone‚Äôs comments. I‚Äôm drowning in love from total strangers! It‚Äôs crazy. Thank you for caring! | Yeah that‚Äôs one thing that really made this scary for me. Usually my plan is to do it a lot more painlessly (I‚Äôm terrified of pain) but it was just so‚Ä¶ impulsive. Idk. Last night I was overcome. Like the shadow monster that‚Äôs always creeping nearby just sorta overtook my mind and didn‚Äôt let me think right anymore. I have wanted to die a lot of times, I‚Äôve even planned it out and written notes‚Ä¶ but last night was some other kind of beast. I never would‚Äôve wanted to die that way. It just sorta culminated last night for some reason.

I‚Äôm better now! I didn‚Äôt do anything. 

Thank you for commenting <3 | Me too <3 | Thank you! The leaning thing is exactly it. Sometimes I forget I‚Äôm ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to lean like that. I pushed almost everyone away irl and now I‚Äôm struggling. I‚Äôm trying to build up that support system again so I have someone to catch me when I fall. And in return I‚Äôll catch them when they fall too. 

Your comment is so sweet <3 and the emojis are so cute, I never get to see the pink hearts in the wild! ü©∑üíñ but my favorite one is the light blue heart lol ü©µ it‚Äôs just so crisp looking! | You‚Äôre so sweet <3 thank you for responding. I am ok now, I‚Äôm safe. I didn‚Äôt do anything and I just went to bed. I feel a little better now in the morning. Thank you so much | You are all so beyond sweet to me, I‚Äôm drowning in love right now! Thank you for your comment <3 I went to bed last night and woke up safe. I‚Äôm ok now. Your words help more than you know. 

Thank you! | Thank you <3 even these comments after I‚Äôd decided to stay home are genuinely helping me. I brushed my teeth and ‚Äúwashed my face‚Äù (I just sorta splashed water on it and dried it off lol). I wasn‚Äôt going to do that, I was just going to stay in bed until I had the energy to get up and shower or eat‚Ä¶ I truly give the credit to these extra comments I have this morning. I feel like‚Ä¶ idk how to describe it. Like I‚Äôm hogging all your time that could be spent on better things. But I‚Äôm also so grateful too. It‚Äôs conflicting. 

Thank you for your care <3 | Thank you for caring, I am so grateful for everything you‚Äôve all done for me. I‚Äôm ok, I‚Äôm safe now. I went to bed and didn‚Äôt do anything bad. I‚Äôm awake now and I‚Äôm trying to be better! Your care means more than you know <3 | OKAY! I didn‚Äôt go, I stayed home. Thank you, I don‚Äôt know why it helps that someone else tells me to stay. It just makes it easier somehow. You‚Äôve helped me more than I can express <3 thank you | Thank you, I may not know you but I know these words now. I may not know the pebble but I know the ripples it left in the water. 

<3 | Honestly this has become a party now hasn‚Äôt it? I know half the comments are my responses but there‚Äôs 138 on the post right now. Holy HELL that‚Äôs a lot of comments! 

Thank you. I‚Äôm not sure what my ‚Äúbig‚Äù reason is, but I have a lot of little reasons. I just didn‚Äôt see them last night. Like, I want to finish The Boys tv show. I want to see the aurora borealis. I want to draw out the comic idea I‚Äôve had and post it online just to see what happens. I want to have another pet cat. I want to eat good foods. 

It‚Äôs just sometimes that creeping, exhausted darkness gets a grip on me and it makes me all foggy. Last night was the worst time so far, but yeah. I‚Äôm better now! I‚Äôm going to be better for now. 

Thank you for caring <3 you‚Äôre all strangers but you‚Äôve all been acting like my friends. It means beyond the world to me. | You‚Äôre right. I hope I can pay it forward one day. I‚Äôm so tired today, but maybe tomorrow I won‚Äôt be as tired. Maybe it‚Äôll take more than a day and that‚Äôs fine. I just need to rest and get my strength up again. 

Thank you for being a crutch for me right now. I am beyond grateful for all this care I‚Äôm receiving <3 | Thank you <3 I slept well, and I appreciate your words so much | Thank you <3 I am so grateful you care | You‚Äôre all so kind. Thank you. So much. <3 I appreciate it all so much. I can never properly explain my gratitude. | Thank you. I didn‚Äôt leave. I went to bed and slept instead <3 I‚Äôm ok now | Yeah, I think we understand each other. I‚Äôm trying to eat breakfast right now but I just keep looking at the two biscuits I have and feeling absolutely no appetite. I‚Äôm trying to take the steps. I‚Äôm just so tired. But I don‚Äôt want to be tired, you know? I want to be hungry. I want to eat. I‚Äôm just so tired. 

I‚Äôm trying though. And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing horrible, if I‚Äôm comparing to last night. Every time I get bummed today I just look at this post and all the comments and I try to like‚Ä¶ squeeze out the energy these people have put here so I can just take one more step. 

I‚Äôm better now, but still drained and tired. I brushed my teeth earlier and now I‚Äôve got these biscuits. It‚Äôs been four hours since I woke up though lmfao. I feel so slow. I‚Äôm doing my best tho

Thank you for commenting <3 I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here right now. It helps knowing someone understands. I believe in you, too! Maybe if we believe in each other then we can lighten the load. I don‚Äôt have to try so hard to believe in me when I know someone else is doing it for me, right? <3 | I stayed <3 hugs back! | You don‚Äôt know what this means to me. Especially right now. I‚Äôm trying to eat breakfast and it‚Äôs just really hard, but you saying these things makes me feel a little lighter in my seat. Thank you. I love you too <3 | Thank you <3 you‚Äôre too kind to me | Thank you, you‚Äôre so sweet! It‚Äôs hard for me to see that beauty, but thankfully I‚Äôm an overly trusting person lol so I‚Äôll try to take your word for it. I‚Äôm overwhelmed with love from all these comments. Thank you for taking the time for me <3 | Fuck now I‚Äôm crying again. Thank you. I feel like I‚Äôm surrounded in a big group hug with all of you. It‚Äôs overwhelming but also so nice. I keep reading comments as I go through my day and it‚Äôs like little bursts of wind underneath my wings helping me stay afloat. 

You have no idea how much your comment means to me. And I know I‚Äôve said that for a lot of comments now‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs all true. I‚Äôm overwhelmed with appreciation. Thank you. | I know pills are a bad choice‚Ä¶ that was never the ‚Äúreal‚Äù plan, it was impulsive. Like a panic choice. Like - I don‚Äôt want to jump off a cliff or anything, but if I felt like my other options weren‚Äôt feasible then maybe I‚Äôd start considering it, you know?

Thank you for taking the time to comment <3 | Thank you <3 x | You‚Äôre so kind <3 I‚Äôm sending a thank-you hug back! | I do that a lot of times (knowing someone else had it worse than me) - I got heavily into philosophy over the quarantine time and I read a lot of stoicism. It‚Äôs weird how most of the time I am so good at keeping a really level head, but then in a crisis it all just disappears as if I never learned it. 

Thank you for the reminder tho! I am using these comments as grounding whenever I start to float away again. This helps more than you know <3 | Honestly! It feels like I‚Äôm laying in bed and everyone else is forming this safe entity who‚Äôs gently petting my hair as I cry myself to sleep. It‚Äôs so nice. I feel like a little child being taken care of. 

Thank you for your comment! You‚Äôre part of that safe entity now too <3 | >Permanent solutions never fix temporary problems 

Honestly I should just tattoo that to my hands. I‚Äôd say forehead, but I don‚Äôt have enough mirrors for that to be a realistic aid haha. Thank you for being here for me <3 I appreciate it. | You‚Äôre all so beautiful and good! I feel like I‚Äôm drowning in love every time I open this app. I‚Äôm so grateful <3 thank you | I actually did end up telling my brother. I‚Äôm kinda having a fight with my dad right now (unrelated to the post, we‚Äôll be ok) so it‚Äôs awkward talking to him‚Ä¶ but my brother has been helping me. He‚Äôs younger than me but still so valuable. 

Thank you for the tip <3 | Ok, I didn‚Äôt!! <3 | I appreciate it <3 I‚Äôm not really religious, but Jesus has never done me wrong either. Thank you for the care ü©∑ | Thank you, it feels stupid but it really does help. Following instructions can be sooo much easier than making choices. Thank you so much | You‚Äôre so considerate, thank you ü©∑ I‚Äôm starting to really love the pink heart emoji after all these comments‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs making an association with the comfort this post has brought me. Thank you, and I hope you‚Äôre doing ok to, stranger!! | I‚Äôm not super religious, but I truly do appreciate it. Religious people get a lot of flack, but I‚Äôve had a couple insanely cool Christians in my life who genuinely changed me for the better. 

A youth pastor named Jason once helped me through an insanely bad time in life. His care for me was so important. I didn‚Äôt think anyone cared, but he took time to visit me in an inpatient ward TWICE. For no reason other than to check on me. I will never forget him. 

So I‚Äôm definitely thankful that Jesus made it possible for Jason to be there for me. <3 | I just woke up and I‚Äôm feeling better - not best, but better! I just wanted to update everyone as best I can. <3 thank you | Thank you, I wish I could hug you all as a thank you‚Ä¶ I woke up feeling a little better than before. I am going to put the pills away so they‚Äôre not in the bag anymore. I feel so bad I made everyone worry, and I‚Äôm so grateful so many people cared. You have no idea how much your comment meant to me. How much it still means to me. I feel indebted to you all. <3 | I‚Äôm doing my best to not give up, but it‚Äôs so hard sometimes. Also happy cake day! It sounds dumb but seeing the little cake emoji by your username kinda makes me feel better lol. Like ‚Ä¶ 1% better, but still that‚Äôs more than none haha | Omg you‚Äôre all so nice to me, I really don‚Äôt feel like I deserve it. I won‚Äôt make us do the whole circular thing where you‚Äôve gotta convince me to accept your care for me, so I‚Äôll just accept it and say thank you <3 | I slept alright! Today I was doing a bit better when I first woke up, but I‚Äôm not nearly as bad as I was last night. I‚Äôm just tired from it all. I‚Äôm trying to eat breakfast biscuits right now. 

To be honest I can‚Äôt remember the teas I‚Äôve tried‚Ä¶ I definitely have tried lemon/honey stuff, but beyond that I couldn‚Äôt tell you the flavors I‚Äôve had. There‚Äôs a tea shop near me that lets you drink the teas before buying them and they have a chocolate tea that‚Äôs AMAZING‚Ä¶ but it just sorta tastes like cocoa. Idk how ‚Äútea‚Äù it is. There‚Äôs a vanilla one that‚Äôs the same, but I don‚Äôt know the brand names or anything‚Ä¶ | Thank you <3 if you ever need to talk yourself, my dms are open, I just might be slow to reply | Thank you <3 I ended up eating 1.5 biscuits (I cut them in half to butter and jam them, but didn‚Äôt eat one of the halves). The first one was hard, the middle one wasn‚Äôt, and I forced the third one a bit. 

Maybe next time the first one won‚Äôt be hard, or I won‚Äôt have to force the third. I‚Äôm trying to be proud of myself, but knowing you are proud of me makes me feel better too‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre all being so kind to me it‚Äôs blowing my mind. Thank you, I feel indebted. | You‚Äôre so nice to me, I appreciate it all so much. I wish I was more‚Ä¶ idk, verbose? I wish I could use words better to express just how much I appreciate and am grateful for all the love you guys showed me last night. 

I woke up safe this morning in my bed, and I feel better now that it‚Äôs no longer dark out. Thank you again <3 | To be honest, less than ideal. I am not at that lowest place anymore‚Ä¶ but the feeling in my gut, as if there‚Äôs a really heavy rock settled in my stomach, is still present. I haven‚Äôt done anything dangerous though. I‚Äôm trying really hard to eat a little bit each day, and I still haven‚Äôt made myself cocoa like I promised the other comments‚Ä¶. But I‚Äôm taking really tiny steps otherwise. | ü©∑ thank you.

u/pettylieskill,370,"Wife left after a cancer diagnosis.. I (m35) was diagnosed with lung cancer in May after weeks of coughing blood and finally gave in and went to the Dr's office. They did the normal routine and standard procedure for the sort of thing x rays and bloodwork. I'm in a hurry to get back to work. I left before they could give me results. Two hours later They asked me to go to ohsu in portland. Nervous about what this could went By myself regrettably, And let them take biopsy samples of my lungs. In record time, they told me that I have stage four lung cancer.  Right then and there, what's the hardest blow I've ever felt. I cry uncontrolably for  the entire drive back home. I pulled over twice to yell as loud as i could. I can only imagine what others were thinking on the highway. I make it home to tell my wife (26f).  I sit her down hand in hand as she's asking me what's wrong. I explained everything the dr said, not asking for anything, just explaining what my prognosis is.  And she immediately pulled her hands back and with a blank look on her the face. she had to pulled her handsn back andbsaid I not going to do this.  i'm not gonna be a part of any of this. I can't be your wife. I can't be married to a cancer patient. Im not her to be a maid. I can't be your nurse. I can't be your chauffeur. I can't do the hospice thing. I'm definitely not the cook.  I'm not trying to be a housekeeper. I'm gonna live my life how I want to. I can't help you. I'm gonna let your mom know what is happening so you can move back home. I still love you.

I hope I would see my kids I she never responded to my texts begging to see the kids. Even if it's 10 minutes to please consider. And the only response i got was a""NOü§¨"".

UPDATE. I can share screenshots with people showing how toxic she was to me. And also how very little value she put in my life



Update as of 1/13/24
I'm sorry if I took  respond to some of you. The intense exhaustion from the chemo 100% sucks. Image taking liek 5 benadryl .then having your stomach wrenching up with the worst bubble mudd gut cramps. I mean the kind where the arches of your feet are hurtin cause your stomach has been imploding from all dry heaving your doing. Follow that up with body aches that will take it right down to your bones. I'm bouncing back asbmt


Thank you. Two those of u who advised me to seek legal counsel. I appreciate Steering me in a better direction. She's been very difficult and very standoffish with allowing my mom and my dad The ability to see their grandkids. She recently Started using the words ""you could see the kids if"". Is the sslfish bullshi tone she uses when talking to my parents About them spending time together. 

 In less than a week went from  absolutely no time with my kids..  To having a hearing for us to establish my parenting time, as well as him planning on advocating for my parents time as well. One of my big concerns is if I die, my parents will never be allowed to see their grandkids. Thats notwhat I want.

I've even made letters and movies for their future spouses.  Explaining why I'm not there but my brothers will keep the promises they made me. Should the girls ever need help. My parents have been a big support and helped me in more ways then what could've asked for. I've written pages and pages of letters to them ad well. Should their mom destroy the pictures we had my family made a massive collage with every picture we have together. It's a 10'' walll that will always be there for the girls in my old room. All my old flannel shirts were made into pillowcases so they can br handed out as the years go by.

wishing you the best! <3 | it's not about simply finding certain traits attractive. yeah, i do hate all the shit that comes with being a woman, but none of those factors add to me wanting to be a man. even if i had to be a hideous man, i would take that over being a woman. yeah, being hideous would suck but at least i wouldn't feel trapped in a body that doesn't even feel like my own.
as far back as i can remember, before i could even entirely process gender (and wayyy before i could process privileges or traits that benefit different genders) i felt wrong. being grouped with girls always made me uncomfortable, this identity just doesn't feel right to me.
it's so much more than thinking ""hmm, being a male seems fun and cool!""
it's the genuine euphoria and validation that i feel when someone refers to me by male pronouns or perceives me to be male. of course, it's hard to explain to someone who isn't trans because you do feel comfortable with the sex you were assigned with + i'm terrible at explaining things :/
(i'm going to assume you're a man for this example, apologies if i'm wrong.) just imagine if people started referring to you by she/her pronouns, grouping you with women, seeing you as a woman... over time‚Äìif not immediately, that would become very jarring. you feeling uncomfortable with that has nothing to do with how you feel towards women, it's discomforting because you KNOW you aren't a woman.
and that only covers the social aspect, of course. seeing yourself as the incorrect gender requires an entirely different, horrible experience that i'm not sure i could describe with words, but hopefully that example was useful.
i hope this answered your question, just ask me if you need something cleared up. :) | i didn't dislike your comment!! sorry for the misunderstanding :,) i didn't perceive your comments as offensive or disrespectful.

u/qtcaela,798,"Tried to kill myself last night - failed and traumatised my mom and dad for life I don‚Äôt really know why I‚Äôm posting this, I guess I feel like people here would understand. I feel so profoundly alone, I know I can talk to my loved ones, but I‚Äôve seen how it breaks their hearts when I tell them how hopeless I feel. So I kept everything to myself and put on fake smiles and happy conversations and (I‚Äôm a recovering alcoholic) didn‚Äôt tell anyone about my relapses etc. I just wanted to be a normal person.

Last night I reached my wits end. I really tried to be better. I tried to keep everyone happy. But I can‚Äôt ignore this deep ache I feel in my heart and soul. An ache that feels like my very existence to the core is not natural, not meant to be there 

So I set up a noose on my curtain rail, wrote a short letter to say goodbye and sorry and got on a chair. My mom walked into my room as I was standing by the curtain and I managed to hide the noose and make an excuse about trying to fix my curtain, she said I should stop being silly and go get dinner, I told her I‚Äôd come just now but she wouldn‚Äôt let up. So.. I just slipped the rope on and jumped off the chair as fast I could. I thought it would kill me fast enough but instead I had my mom trying to hold my body up while I suffocated and my dad trying to cut the rope down with a knife. 

It‚Äôs the next day and I feel a thousand times worse that I put everyone through hell AND couldn‚Äôt even get the job done. I‚Äôm a horrible human being, because despite all of that, I still want nothing more than to stop existing. 
I truly don‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôll ever be able to live a life that isn‚Äôt agonising for me 90% of the time. How does one ever come to terms with such a thing.

u/realeventthrowaway,179,"I‚Äôm paranoid and terrified that I‚Äôm a pedophile. I‚Äôm not attracted to children but my mind keeps ruminating about it 
When I was 18 years old I was looking for erotic stories online (I prefer to read smut). I was into some really weird shit such as exhibitionism and sometimes incest porn (I know, disgusting). I found a thread on a sub-reddit that had relevance to my exhibitionism kink.  


While I was masturbating and scrolling through threads, I see a comment from a man talking about engaging in sexual acts with his stepdaughter (who I assumed was an adult). I didn't think much of it and eventually just put my phone down and ""finished up."" Afterwards I got a bad feeling from the comment and went back to check. I realized that I had missed context (I was skimming over stuff and not reading carefully) implied sexual behavior had occurred before she was of legal age. I checked his post history and determined that he was a fucking pervert. I understand that people often post weird fantasies online that are fake, but this one seemed too real. I went back and reported other suspicious comments from that subreddit (it wasn't moderated very well). I had never come across anything super sketchy before so I wasn‚Äôt really expecting it.


As a result, I almost had a panic attack and felt extremely angry. I then reported the individual to the FBI or NCMEC (I forgot which one). I have told my friends about this, four therapists, and my girlfriend; they all think that it's no big deal and that I did the right thing. I can't stop ruminating about it and I've spent the past few days completely consumed by it. I've not done anything but ruminate and replay the events from that day.  


My mind has convinced me that I'm an evil monster who enjoys child abuse. At the time I had imagined the stepdaughter mentioned as a woman older than me at the time (mid 20s to 30s) with a heavier build, large breasts and pubic hair. I just skimmed through the comments and wasn't really reading between the lines.  


Since then I've been super fucking careful where I get my erotic stories from. I feel extreme guilt and almost feel responsible for it. I feel like I sought out literal CSAM. I've never fantasized about children in my life, and I've never been attracted to a child. When I was 18 I worried myself sick about being attracted to 17 year olds.  

I feel like a monster, but people tell me I did the right thing. I loathe pedophiles. I hate them. I hope anyone that consumes CP rots in hell personally. Am I going fucking crazy?

But my mind keeps screaming at me that they‚Äôre lying and I‚Äôm a fraud to everyone around me.

All of my romantic partners have said that I‚Äôm overreacting, my friends said the same. It feels like I‚Äôm living in a different reality than everyone else where I‚Äôm an evil person. | Yeah I was diagnosed with OCD at age 8. It‚Äôs constantly changed themes and this one got really bad around my teen years for some reason.

I still can‚Äôt seem to let it go. | That‚Äôs around the time it started for me. :( | Thank you, this helped a lot. I‚Äôve spoken with four therapists about it and I still can‚Äôt get it off my mind. It kinda alternates between this and other worries and fears I have

I‚Äôve certainly been very careful where I get my erotica from since then. I hadn‚Äôt ever encountered something like at age 18 and it shook me. I‚Äôm older now and realize how fucked up the world is.

I should‚Äôve been more careful. I truly hope that the victim gets justice if it wasn‚Äôt just some creeps fantasy. I hope my report did something if that‚Äôs the case.

Thank you for this comment, it did help greatly. | I‚Äôm really sorry that happened to you. That‚Äôs super fucked up.

u/sappy_pototo,351,"I slept with a prostitute and now I feel like ending it all This is gonna be a long story. So tldr at the end. Wanted to type this all out. 

I grew up in a very religious and conservative environment. I was indoctrinated into this religion from a very young age. Not to mention that the entire society and culture was structured to be very conservative as well. This included very little to no interaction between the boys and girls. From a very young age, our schools were segregated as well. 

It was in this all boys school/environment where I started to develop my understanding of sex. It was not a good environment to do that. Things were super toxic. Sex and porn were constant topics in the classroom. The school was so bad at handling all of this that almost our entire classroom was watching pornography in the IT lab. Even with the professor being there sometimes. There were kids who would jerk off in the class sometimes or show their penises to each other. Something that I partook in as well. I remember our library lesson was also mostly about this subject. We would get the biology textbook and go to the chapters about reproduction. But it was not just reading, other students had drawn profane images on the book. So we would look at them and perhaps make our own contribution. 

This was also the time when pornography became a thing in my personal life. It's difficult to remember how much was there but there was plenty of it. Being from a conservative environment, conversations about sex was a taboo. So my introduction and understanding of sex was solely developed through pornography and my school environment. My parents never talked about it. Many years later, my dad only briefly mentioned something about wet dreams but that's about it. 

This early part of my life I vehemently hate. Most people find their childhood innocence something that they cherish. But I didn't have that I suppose. I hate this part of my life so much that if I can go back in that, I'd kill that part of me.

Sometime after, I moved out of this school to a co-ed school. Things got better. My outlook improved. I struggled to make female friends though. And there was a lot of shame and guilt associated with even trying because of my religious upbringing. I remember one time, our school had an event and one of my female classmates tagged me in a post on Facebook. I did not have any privacy on my account so my dad saw it. And he got very angry at me, even though I never asked her to share it and the picture wasn't even with me and her, it was of the entire class. My dad forced me to block that female classmates on Facebook. 

This school was in a more progressive city. So kids were in relationships. And I remember being very intrigued by that idea. Intellectually I always thought that dating and relationships were a good way to know your partner and if they fit. But I thought that God knew better and I should stop thinking these stupid thoughts. But I knew to stay away from it. However, this was the place where I developed my first really bad crush. I liked her so much. But the purity values of my religion always made me feel bad about even thinking about holding her hand, let alone anything else. I used to take pride that my thoughts about her were pure. That when I'd day dream about her I would never think about holding her hand or kissing her, even after marriage (in my head). I felt awful about watching pornography because of the same reasons so I started trying to avoid it. And I did. I would not watch porn or jerk off for six months. This also became my first experience with rejection but that's a separate story. 

Eventually I entered university which was one of the most liberal universities in my country. I had heard stories about people being in relationships and having sex and I had heard about my parents concerns about that with me. So I decided to avoid having relationships. I did want to have female friendships, to improve myself and my confidence with talking to girls. Also, to further improve my view on women and topics like gender roles. Due to growing up in a religious family, I had a very patriarchal view on these subjects. Nevertheless, I felt lonely and I craved romantic love and affection. This was also the time when pornography re-entered in my life. But I hated myself for watching it. I was ashamed of being someone who interacted with pornography, especially on somewhat regular basis now. Which for me meant once a week. 

University was also the place where I started getting suicidal. I never tried to kill myself but I started self harming, and the methods for worse and more extreme. When I graduated from University, I left with all these feelings with me. The suicidal ideation, the self harm, the shame and guilt, and the loneliness. 

All these feelings got worse. Eventually, through some reflection and realizations. I left the religion behind. And I felt betrayed. I thought It always made sense to me that relationships (even ones that involved pre-marital sex) were not bad. But I never allowed myself to think that. But also, I realized that a religion that focused on purity had none itself due to our various injunctions. At this point, I grow a desire to explore this side of me and thought to turn towards paying for it. But I stopped myself. The most I did at that point was buy lube for the first time to know what that feels like. 

However, I wanted to try my luck at relationships and I did. Even in cases where I knew pre-marital sex was not possible (due to their beliefs), I thought if they accept me as a irreligious person, I don't mind. At this point, my parents also were pushing to get me married. My family has a lot of marriages done to improve business ties with other families. So now that we were of age my dad wanted to do that too. However, I declined...many times. I declined often enough that at one point my dad insulted me by saying that ""are you gay?"" (For context, being from a very religious culture and country, people here very strongly hate LGBTQ people... Including my family). Regardless, I tried the to enter into a relationship for two years. 

While I tried to make sure the intention was to be in a relationship and not to have sex (I would give myself extra time to reflect on this). Near the tail end of this time period, things started to feel muddled. I felt like I wanted to know what that felt like and I felt bad for being a virgin at 25. I felt even worse for consuming pornography and that being the only sexual outlet I had ever had. This went on for a while. 

Recently, these feelings become heightened. And I wanted to experience what it was like and I wanted to get this feeling out of my system. So I had sex with a prostitute. And I hate myself even more now. 

I hate that I did it. I feel like I've ruined myself. Despite intellectually not having any problem with sex work or sex workers in general and not judging others who I know have done the same. I can't help but feel awful about myself. Since it happened, I can't help but feel constantly anxious and depressed. And if I was suicidal before, I can't help but feel that after this, I have to go through with it. I have to. And I feel like it's about time that I wipe my wretched self off this planet. I have been thinking about this ever since it happened. I feel so done with life. I already wrote my suicide note and goodbyes a while ago. It would be kinda funny to write an update. So I feel like all I need to do now is pull the trigger. 

Thank you to everyone who made it till the end. I appreciate you reading my ramblings. 

Tldr: I always had a weird and unhealthy relationship with my sex life and sexuality. I recently had sex with a prostitute and I hate myself for it. I have been suicidal before but I feel like at this point I'm done with my life. I already wrote my suicide note and goodbyes a while ago and I feel like I just to need to plan my death and get this over with. 

Edit: Holy moly, I didn't expect this post to blow up. Thank you everyone for taking the time to read my post and to give so many thoughtful replies. I'll try to get to them on their own too but I thought I'll share an edit here. But I'm trying grateful for all the love and support. 

I understand that maybe these feelings are because of the environment I was raised in but that doesn't stop me for feeling bad. Just try clarify, I was not raised a Christian. Regardless, I appreciate all the replies from people commenting on my religious experience from a Christian lens, I think the perspectives shared are still accurate and valuable. To the christians in the comments, I am not religious but I appreciate the push to forgive myself. 

All those who complimented my writing. Thank you soo much. I actually enjoy some creative writing as a hobby, so I'm glad that you found my writing articulate and admirable. Means alot to hear that. 

To everyone who shared their own stories. I truly appreciate all of you talking about something personal for my sake. They were very insightful and relatable. I'm sorry to hear that all of you had to go through something terrible too. I hope all of you are in a better place yourself. 

Like I mentioned in my post, I intellectually don't think there's anything wrong with sex work. I would not judge a friend who did the same as I did. I have heard of stories of friends of friends who have done the same and never judged them. But I can't help but feel awful about myself. 

I did it a few days ago, but when it happened I immediately went into this state of panic and anxiety. I also started to suicide ideate hard. The event itself feels like it was not part of this world. It feels like there's a gap in my mind during the time all this happened. And then the event itself exists in a separate dimension or something. I it's weird feeling, not sure if I'm explaining it properly. I also feel like I ruined myself because it's feels like a stain that I can't get rid off. 

For the people commenting about self-love. That is something that I do struggle with and I'm trying to work on it to middling success. But my inner voice is very harshly critical for sure.

Again, thank you everyone for your kind words. ",u/sappy_pototo,3,"Yeah but it being in the past only seems to solidify it as a stain, in my mind. Like it's something I can't get rid off now. I hope not. | I'm not religious. And yeah I understand what you mean. I even agree with you. However it's difficult for my emotional self to not have all these negative feelings even though the rational side would probably agree with you. I wouldn't ever judge a friend who did the same. But I can't help but do it for me. | But how do I get over the fact that this would always be a part of me, it'll always be a part of my story as a person. | Thank you!! I do enjoy writing as a hobby. I suppose so. Feels very real though. 

I suppose so. It's just that, this feels too big to come back from. 

I wasn't a Christian but yeah I think the guilt part still applies. Perhaps my parents are you blame, I have a whole host of issues there. But that's another can of worms. 

That's a huge compliment. Thank you. Maybe, I don't know I don't think my writing is on that level, for a novel. Especially since it's not my first language as well. 

That's an interesting observation, thank you for sharing. | Ok, I didn't know that. And I love Bryan Cranston. I have his book but I have not read it yet. That's comforting though. | Thank you for sharing your story. I really appreciate it. And I'm sorry you had to go through all of that. Are you doing better now? Also, if you don't mind me asking, were you a Jehovah's witness? 

I will. I want to talk this through with my therapist but I'm just not sure if I'm comfortable with saying all of this. 

That's a very sweet sentiment. Thank you!! I'll try to, I struggle with not being very harsh with myself. | I'll try to. | I'm sorry to hear you had to go through that. It sure is, I'm hoping have a positive turn there. Thank you!! And you too!! | Nope. | I am. I guess not. Maybe it's just my natural tendency to react that way with sexual changes in my life. Hmm I see. That's cool. Probably much more safer too. 

You worked at a porn studio? That seems like an interesting experience. Would love to hear more about it if you wanna share. 

I guess I just never thought I'd find myself here. And yeah that's true. 

I'm not a Christian but that's pretty interesting. I never knew about that. 

I guess not. Thank you!! | I hope your your shame isn't as overpowering as mine is. And thank you!! | I did talk to a close friend. He was very supportive and nice. It's just that I couldn't help get extremely anxious and feel suicidal. 

Thank you!! I really enjoy writing as a hobby. So I'm happy to hear that. | I'm not gonna say from where, since I'm a bit uncomfortable with that.

My understanding is that ever since I raised it, they now sit closer together in the office too. | While that would be ideal (every last dollar would go towards causes preventing it!!!), its difficult/near impossible to sue in this country üòî | At the time there was physical evidence. Yes shouted, and I think I left a mark near his neck too. I didn't go to the police because, honestly, I was terrified state. I wish I had have though. | Unfortunately the person who did this to me is highly religious... | Unfortunately work made it incredibly tricky to gather evidence... they blocked my access the same day they forced me to go on leave, at managers request. I wasn't even allowed to go back on to say goodbye to colleagues. | Thank you ü´Ç | That's really useful advice, greatly appreciated!!!

Im 28 years old, i feel much older though, been depressed, lonely, ugly and overweight my whole life.

I just have enough, my head burns from self hatred and sadness. There is nobody who ever liked me.
My ""friends"" didnt go to my birthday party, because nobody cared to even have a few hours with me.

The girl i liked ghosted me, before that she just used me to look for her dog so she could fuck around.

My parents are selfish narcissists, my mother always hated me, my father never cared about me.

I just want it to end finally, i had 3 suicide attempts, but this one will be the final one. 12 gauge to the head. Tomorrow i will throw some acid, be happy and think about death, the day after i will shoot myself.

I hate being born, i hate myself, i hate humanity, i hate this world",u/soontobedeadguy,12,"I wanted to thank you all, everyone who wrote something and to all the beautiful people who send me dm's.
You achieved that i will not kill myself for at least a while and i will try to confront my inner demons and get rid of all them toxic people in my life.

I wont delete this throwaway account, in my darkest hour it gave me a lot of hope, so many people who wrote me and talked to, all who didnt knew me at all.

Thank you all again from the bottom of my heart! | My self harm was eating till i weighted 175 kgs so the opposite of you in that regart.

Im honest, i love being alone, but i hate being lonely.
I just cant endure it anymore, so why carry on? | Im so sorry man, i was that sad suicidal kid too and i know how much it sucks. Sadly nobody cares about me, its a masked world you know.
But let me give you advice, watch out that you dont get fat, believe me and dont do drugs until at least 25 years old.

I think that been 2 big mistakes of mine | I hope it takes the fear of dying away. I think it helps with that and wgen im sober again i will shoot myself | Im sorry to hear that.
I think the best someone could wish for me is death.

Im here to long already, i know 28 doesnt seem old but i really feel like im 58.
Nothing will improve for me, but you still could. | I think one is about 225mg | I think hbo's rome is the best series. Watched it 10 times already. Now im doing a james bond marathon, so i try to keep myself from doing nothing and i watch a lot.
It still wont help me sadly.

Im too fat to enjoy food, i feel guilty eating tbh. | It always depends on the mood im in | The people i helped just use me and then left me. | I really know that feeling, there will be an end to the suffering | Yes im okay thank you! | I dont understand tbh üòÖ

If i have a question or if i want to answer a question? | Im really surrounded by some of the worst people and i always attract the worst people to me.
I think thats because i grew up hating myself, because my parents are narcissistic.

Sometimes i just want to change my number and never hear from anyone ever again. My family, everyone i know just gone from my life. 

But i dont know any other typ of relationships, like i say i grew up being hated. I was a sick child, nearly died. Was in hospital the first years of my life and my mother bullied me for that. Then i got fat and im not a good looking person all around, but being fat makes it even worse. Stretch marks everywhere.

I hate myself more than i could anyone else. | It doesnt do it for me anymore. My whole life is suffering, food doesnt taste good anymore and thats a lot coming from me, a fat person.

I really dont care about material things, i never thought i wish i had more things or more money
All i wanted is a normal day, where i didnt hate myself, where i know i was loved, wanted and enough.

But shooting myself is at least an action to end this suffering and im full of hope of achieving that. | I did a lot, i lost 30 kg, moved in february, quit my old job and got a better one. My life still is hell.

I was in therapy a long time, i never had a happy day in my life so what do you wanna tell me | Im sorry, i dont get why someone would treat you bad because of skin color or gender. 
People suck and its the worst if your own parents are against you too | I think the esasy way out would be waiting till im dead. Killing myself is very hard, but at least i would have done something to stop all that.

I dont need anything from life anymore, just want it to stop. | My head wont have a roof soon though | But the eternity was much nicer then the short bad thing we call life now. So why not go back there now? | I hope nirvana waits after death, i need no afterlife please.
For the band, i like a few songs and curt cobain achieved my goal with his shotgun. | Thank you so much! | Its like that for me too, everytime i think there is progress i lose again. Im in a losing war since 28 years | I know you mean well and i thank you for that.

I hope your life turns out to be great. | Yes if there would be a god, why wont he just let me sleep forever.
Just never wake up, but it never happens.

Why in 1,5 months? Is there something special waiting? | No, i took 3 of them one time and that was too much tbh. I couldnt enjoy that i felt like, its weird to explain, i felt like my body was formed like the mars rover. I know weird, but my eyes were on a stick away from me and i felt like a box, mars rover is the best i could explain it! üòÖ

But i still knew where i was, what was going on etc.

I heard dmt should give ego death | I think humans always will hate fat people, i dont know if being ugly or being fat is worse to society.

But loving yourself is the best thing one can achieve, i hope that i too will at least find myself okay some day. | Im glad you feel better | But how can i stop hating myself?

I really really dont like myself and i mean i cant even write sonething good about myself down without feeling sick.

My therapist once told me to write just one side of thinks im grateful for and wgich i like about myself.
I nearly went insane, after a few hours i took the textbook, threw it into the sink and pissed on it.

Yeah im really not normal in the head | I lost 30 kgs already. I was very obese, i weighted 175 kgs. Now im at 144 kgs but i feel even more ugly than before tbh. | I was in therapy a long time and antidepressents just helped me to be better at work, which i dont care about anymore.

Look lets say in future, there will be better days for me, it wouldnt matter if i killed myself before that. I wouldnt witness that, i wouldnt care because im dead.
The great equalizer, the only fair and good thing about life is death. | Its not only about a girlfriend, of course thats a big point too.
I just font get any of the normal human privileges and pleasures that most people have.

Family thst cares? Friends who care? I cant even have a dog because its not possible to.

Its just lonelieness, forever lasting it seems. | Thank you. Humor is the only thing that keeps me going. | I wish i could, but life always tells me to end it.
Im like a cancer and life tries to heal the world from me.

So many people die, i am one of the many who will leave not note except pain | Wow thats crazy, how did you achieve that? | Are you okay? | I really feel that nobody ever liked me. My parents hated me, friends arent real friends, they dont want so see me unless i do something to make a meeting happen. Women dont like me, i only was in love 2times both times ended very bad.

There wouldnt be anything lossed if i died, only gained because i wont suffer anymore.

Life shouldnt be suffering without meaning, even Victor Frankl said thats the worst thing anyone can endure and he was in an conentration camp.

I only would harm myself, i wouldnt kill anyone else, i dont have the right to do that. | Thank you, but sometimes i feel cursed. Like sonething is genetically so wrong with me that people have to hate me.

Isnt everything temporary since we are all dying? | The dog would be alone nearly everyday for 10 hours

I love dogs though | I will try that too, i just want to feel something before im gone.
Thats so awesome, im glad you had that moment with your father. I always cry when i see loving parents relationships and things like that.
Never had that. | The girl i wrote about gave me her dog for 2 weeks last year. She is an 8 year old grey amstaff terrier and it was so great with her.
I loved to go for walks with her and just having an companion.

The numbers are so hopeless... | 42 years, im happy for yall, I just wanted my forever person to grow old with like you two do | Surgery cannot add length, absolutely none can outside of cutting off your real penis and crafting one from flesh from your forearm thats numb and gross. 

Also length is my severe deficit. 

The number of women like you are far too rare in the population for it to be possible in my lifetime. 

Its hard enough to find love with normal genitals. Its basically impossible as a small man. | Selfish as it sounds, I like oral, giving and receiving, so as long as I was receiving oral I'd never need penetration. 

I'd be perfectly happy with that and for me its about pleasing my partner not just getting mine. 

I need to make them feel good, thats why it bothers me so much not being average size, i want to provide üôÅ | Unfortunately there isn't. | Im happy for you, but for any partner who isn't of a slim athletic build i am too short to actually go inside. It's not even capable of the act. | Not enough women like you to make it statistically relevant. I could date for multiple lifetimes and never find one who would overlook my flaw. | As i have said to others, look for yourself on the dating, sex advice, and NSFW subs here on reddit and you'll see. PiV is a big deal to most hetero women | Link one that isn't just filled with gay men or sex workers looking for subs wanting SPH 

I know all about kinks | Two and a half is probably all i can get inside in the best case though. 

I dont need PiV so it doesn't mean much for me, but it seems a pretty large majority of women really do and I just don't know how to keep living with the odds against finding someone who can go without PiV being so terrible for me. | You ever watch x-files? I am the poster on the wall of Mulder's office. ""I WANT TO BELIEVE"" 

I miss the 90s | I know, y'all got your own problems, and i feel for you, i really do. Not sure what to say other than that. | I'm sorry you feel anything similar to me, i don't wish this on anybody. Be kinder to yourself than i was to me. 

And don't worry about my end being painless. 

Marine Corps taught about something called the T zone. I'll be lights out before my body is done falling. | A pencil sharpener? Ouch! üò≠ | Im probably neurodivergent as well so I get where you're coming from. | I have had a few people comment on my post here about vaginismus and every time I see a lady mentioning their struggle with it my heart breaks for them. 

I appreciate you wanting to make me feel better, to give me some hope. Thankfully, in a very crazy turn of events I have recently found an amazing woman who is absolutely over the moon with me, and I feel the same for her. 

I don't know if you want to go without PiV but I wanted to tell you that if you didn't miss it, there are men who don't need it and would be happy with all the other things. I know because I am that guy. I have seen others say the same. 

Just like you responded to my post, you too can find those things you want. I know it.

I want love and sex. I'm physically barred from ever finding it. 

Killing my worthless ass self. That's the only option here. | Having kids means you had enough value as a person to have had sex. That's the real problem, its not that its so important, its the fact that I am too worthless to be loved because my one body part is defective trash. 

I went a while doing my own thing alone before I realized I am alone not by choice but because i am worthless as a human | I hope so, I dont want to have to go through with this, I just don't want to feel hopeless anymore | Yeah for now, trying to be polite and reply to everybody | Doesn't exist. Women do not, will not, and have not ever like a micropenis. Not a slightly smaller one. One that cannot penetrate a vagina. 

You want proof? Go look at all the small penis themed NSFW subs here on Reddit. The comments are packed with nothing but gay men, most of whom also have small dicks. Absolutely ZERO women. 

And I'm hetero. I'd be put in front of a firing squad than have sex with a man. 

As for people loving the person. That's bullshit too. Genitals are deal breakers. | Thats so terrible he did that üòü | It is if it means I'll be alone and sexless for the rest of my miserable ass life. | Why do you need to know? | There is no procedure for length. You are very misinformed. 

There is only a procedure that adds a layer of silicone under the skin to increase the girth and the flaccid length (it forces the penis to stay at erect length when flaccid due to the rigidity of the silicone tube that is installed) but does absolutely nothing for functional/erect length. None. 

After roughly age 21 hormone treatments such as HGH do NOT work. I am nearly double that age. 

So fuck off. | Its not that im starved or anything like that, its knowing that a physical part of me makes me too worthless to be loved. | That would cause resentment within me, I am not asexual so I would still want to have sexual moments with a partner, it would be wrong of me to pursue an asexual person because of this. | Y'all can. 

I tried, didn't work. | Its not about my dick directly, its about never being able to have a love and sex life. If enough women liked micros that finding a lifelong partner was possible, i would NOT care about my size at all, but its functionally too inferior for women so i hate it and i fucking hate my worthless ass self. | Not for length. They can add some girth but nothing for erect length. Its simply untreatable. | I'm not sure how much longer I want to keep responding to comments on this post, or if I will delete it or not but I wanted to clarify to you that I do not see penetration as the end all be all of sex. 

My concern is based on the number of women who do need it and for whom it is a deal breaker if my dick is too small. Which is apparently a whole hell of a lot of them. | I will be taking the .44 pill actually. | There are no surgeries that add erect length, which is my physical deficit. | I may hate myself for having a useless dick, but I can appreciate a good pun. | I wish they didn't feel that way üò≠ I don't want anyone to feel this way | Check the subs, dating and NSFW, you'll see for yourself.

Most extenders don't allow the wearer to slide at all while wearing it. I have a very tough time with the idea of them due to this plus never getting to feel the inside of one's partner. 

I have no problem using other toys, including double penetration using vibrators etc 

As for your last bit, it could be something like that but all i know is I have been too small when i did date still. | Thanks, it's been an absolute whirlwind. Im still not sure how this is even all really happening. 

I still have doubts about my self worth, but I have major depression and that's just how it is living with that. I have been therapy for that, working on managing it, but knowing for sure that this part of my body i cannot change hasn't completely locked me out of love, its taken away a big source of self loathing knowing that someone loves me despite my physical flaws. | Because I'm an evil motherfucker | Check the dating subs on this site. Doesn't exist for micropenis, if it can't PiV penetrate, hetero women almost universally will not tolerate it. | Fair response. There are statically irrelevant numbers who do, fractions of a percent. I was expressing in hyperbole. I'm a worthless shitbag, making mistakes is what I do. 

This doesn't change the outcome. 

I am well aware about attitudes. I am a lot older than you probably think I am, I didn't always hate myself for my useless dick. I used to be pretty successful at getting dates. Obviously the issue was always later on.  

So I became this way after discovering first hand I am not big enough, that I am subhuman trash. Worthless waste of biological matter. | Dating pool is too small for me to have any hope. So I am checking out. I am taking control of what i can and ending my worthless life. 



Also, I just wanted to say that I know about that condition you speak of. I know men are assholes, and it must not be easy for you. I wish you the best. | I haven't dated since 2022. | I wouldnt say hate. That is hyperbole on my part. But definitely the vast majority are turned off at a minimum. 

I know my attitude doesn't help, but i didn't turn into this freak of self hatred until after I stopped dating | Women see it as y'all have an ""excuse"". The problem for cis men having a tiny dick is that women get the ""ick"" over it, because cis men are supposed to have at least 4.5 inches, but how they see trans men, well its normal for you guys to be really small. 

I know y'all dudes got your own problems though. I feel for ya, it's rough for y'all. | I know ü•∫ sometimes it just seems like so few people do like little ones that I wont find someone who does

Thank you for replying, I appreciate it | Just look on the subs here about dating and sex, if a man can't have PiV is a non starter completely for the vast majority of women. | Good for you. | Im gonna be real with you, when the day comes i don't want sex anymore, I will be extremely upset for not being able to have it while my body was still capable of it. 

You are welcome to be happy with your life, but this is mine and i refuse to live with this bullshit. | I've known about the condition for some time, it makes me so sad. I'd love a woman regardless if she could receive me, I've seen one gal who was and probably still is so distraught she was making posts about it everyday in different subs. 

I tried to tell her it didn't make her less of a woman or unlovable, it was heartbreaking to me | I have things to take care of. I need to give away my few valuable items and fix my car, withdraw my 401k etc etc, so I can give them to the few people I give a shit about. 

You seem excited to witness my demise, want me to livestream it? | Lawful Evil 

Ever play D&D? | That level of insecurity is exhausting. I get it.  

I've never been appreciated by a woman the way those two men were by your friends, so there's no way for me to say if I would or not. 

My size was completely irrelevant to me for years until I became aware that's why dates stopped after things got physical. | Women have posted here about small dicks making them feel like their partner is a child, thus the ""ick"" 

Ive spent far too much time on this site in a spiral trying to find hope. 

Instead I found that I am worthless. | Oh my üò≥

Mine is like that when soft, it sticks out enough i can use toys like strokers when it's hard ü´£ but still pretty short

I'd be happy with it as long as whoever i am with is ok with me and my size  

I too think sex is mostly mental, I feel it starts from within us, our minds, rather than the sensations of touch. I envy that you can orgasm without being touched, that's amazing üòä | Yeah well I have control over one thing. Whether or not my worthless corpse still lives. 

I'm doing it on my terms and I'm taking my revenge against my worthless body for destroying my fucking life. | Not universal sure, not 100% hate micros. However thera are not enough women out there for me to find one though. 

I appreciate you though. I really do. I'm just done living. | The longest mine has ever been is 4 inches as well, about as thick as a peeled banana, it looks more like 3 if you don't press down around the base though | You go without it and get back to me there chief. 

And if you're asexual, your opinion matters less on this than literally anyone in existence. | With the shit y'all deal with you're more of a man than any cis man I know. 

For what my word is worth any way | Theres things i want to do but the self hatred i feel every time i get an inkling of arousal or when ever i simply wish i had a romantic companion to share a cup of coffee with on the porch, ruins the enjoyment of literally every one of those things. 

I used to be in love with motorcycling. The realization that once i get home and have to face an empty house and empty bed, meant that all of the joy i get from it is sapped completely before im done taking my helmet off. 

Its ruined my fucking life. 

I'm glad you moved on. Im glad you have happiness or whatever but also i never got any sort of real love in my life at all and i have never had satisfying physical encounters of any kind. 

So i have nothing and I can't escape that i am unchangeably too worthless for love. 

So I'm taking vengeance on my worthless body. That's what is going down. | The only thing i ever had going for me is i am naturally stocky, ironically enough... | I tried living for myself. This where I ended up. 

Not everyone is the same. 

Im happy for you, though it hurts my heart that you feel so negatively about your skin tone and makes me mad at the men who devalued you for it. They were wrong. 

I have made my choice about this.

u/t0eCaster,1047,"Holy shit I hate humanity I want to die so bad. I am not interested in participating in the genetic lottery ruled by hormones & socializing know as ""the human experience""

We are literally all shallow apes that are simply searching for the best fuck to get the best offspring, then half of us look for the best pushover to raise the best fucks kid. It truly doesn't go deeper than that. There are plenty of sidequests along the way sure, but the fundamental path we are set on by our biology is pretty much decided at birth.

Modern concepts of love and romance are just shit we made up to try and collectively gaslight society into keeping our animalistic side deeply buried, and the fucked up part is, it worked. It worked so goddamn well, that we actually believe we are better than animals. We just aren't lol. We ARE animals. A little smarter than our peers, sure, and we have a little less hair than our cousins, but we are fundamentally the same.

No one is honest with themselves or others. All you have to do is observe someone's behavior, listen to what they say, and you quickly realize that something is VERY FUCKED UP HERE. Why are people so unhappy? Why are suicide rates climbing? Why are people contradicting themselves from the day they're born to the day they die?

Because we are all a bunch of mindfucked, repressed monkeys that don't understand why we feel so miserable. It's really that simple.

Humanity is ugly. People are fundamentally stupid on average. They go through every hoop to always be right or save their ego or believe what they want to believe regardless of new information. They don't know how to think. They only know that they feel a certain way and nothing else matters. You selfish braindead fucks. They aren't concerned with truly understanding other people: they're more interested in putting themselves on a pedestal and damning any negative behavior from others and classifying them as irredeemable. They aren't interested in empathizing: they're interested in projecting their own emotions on someone elses experience, and they genuinely think they're a good person for it, declaring themselves ""empaths"" and participating in this disgusting masturbatory ego trip while patting themselves on the back for emotionally splooging all over themselves. Fucking yikes.

I hate all of you. I hope one day you see the world from where I see it now and you realize how utterly shit you are. Everyday I dream of not waking up. I always hope that one of our sociopathic overlords hits the big red button and resets technology. I don't want to be here.

u/the_lone_duckperson3,600,"My 10 year old brother tried to kill himself yesterday  He hung himself on the top bunk of his bed, thankfully my dad caught him just as he passed out and saved his life. I don't understand how he even knew to do that.

There was no indication beforehand that he would do this and I have no idea why he did it. He lives a more normal life than I do ffs hes physically active and has friends and good grades and a supportive family and no prior history of mental illness. 

When asked why he would do this he just mumbled something about missing his aunt who died a year ago. I doubt that's the only reason but he just keeps saying he doesn't know.

I've been suicidal myself but I've always been too scared to go through with it, he's literally the he last person I'd ever expect to do something like this.

It‚Äôs weird, it‚Äôs like this inner monologue that never goes away. Sometimes it‚Äôs in the back of my mind and sometimes it‚Äôs all I can think about.

u/throwaway8t437,217,"Finally got my gun permit. Picking up a gun later this week likely. I've realized over time that the only truly painless way to die would be to blow my head off. Nothing left. With hanging, you choke or break your neck and die. With drugs, you'll likely just end up getting very sick and throwing up. Jumping off a bridge? I'll be scared the whole way down.

But a gun? I get to just pull a trigger, and bam. Black. I'm honestly excited.

Just gotta make sure to aim it correctly so I don't end up one of those misfigured freaks. I'll probably just stand by a body of water so if the shot somehow doesn't kill me I'll drown while unconscious. 

Sorry mom, sorry dad. Sorry to everyone. I just can't deal with this shit anymore. I'll be remembered as the lazy chump who blew his head off.

u/throwaway_674563,101,"The void really stares back at you, huh? I stood on the roof a couple nights ago. I had some music in my ears and gave myself until the pack of smokes was finished to decide if I should take the step. 

I stood on the edge, lighting the last cigarette, I took a drag and looked down. The faint hum of the city coming through the headphones, the cold breeze in my hair. It felt almost magical, enticing, beckoning for me, almost begging me to take the step. 

A song started playing. Rises the moon. It broke  me out of the trance. My ex girlfriend used to sing it to me whenever I felt under the weather. I stepped back, fell on the ground and started crying like I never cried before. Everything, all the emotions and feelings I stuffed down and ignored for the past couple of months (because I couldn't let myself feel, had to focus on keeping and getting life in order) just came out. I realized what I was doing and couldn't believe it. I realized how much I have to lose and nothing to gain. How selfish that would be. How much pain it would cause everyone around me. That it probably would literally kill my grandma. 

When I was done bawling my eyes out I went to the ER and put myself on hold. I came home today.

u/tired_throwaway22,181,Hey I‚Äôm legit in a bathtub Hi! I‚Äôve been carving superficial marks into my wrist and listening to bright eyes. Can someone give me some encouragement to just finish the job??? Please tell me to get a job done for the first time in my life ,u/tired_throwaway22,183,"Good news! Didn‚Äôt do it. Scratched the shit out of my wrist but still here and still severely depressed. Going to bring this up to psych and going to have to switch some meds for sure. I wish I did it but hey, new chance today. | I can do this | Hang on how do you do photos | So, it‚Äôs been 4 days. This is such a terrific avenue for people in crisis to get their voice out (I truly don‚Äôt have people to talk to about this. Being an extroverted nearly 40 year old white cis male is just masking 99% of the time so my friendships are surface level and to talk about a crisis leads to bad times or judgement). But, I figured it may be nice if anyone is doing down the list of posts and wondering if there are ever follow ups. So here you go. 

‚ÄúScratch‚Äù is the best way I can describe what happened. I scratched my wrist about 20-30 times. Some of them are healing now. I am wearing a large wrist guard saying I fell on a run and hurt my wrist so no one can see. Got some makeup that matches my skin tone for any of the rogue/long scratches. Other than that, wearing long sleeves in Florida summer has been‚Ä¶ difficult to conceal. No long term damage (always a chance for infection but I‚Äôm putting my faith in good ole bacitracin and ignorance). 

I have an appointment with a new psych tomorrow. I have not told them about the crisis I had yet. I also don‚Äôt know about telling my psychologist either. Here‚Äôs the thing - I don‚Äôt know if I actually want help or not. I truly do not see how the worry/pain/stress makes any of this worth it. I love all of you for showing such compassion and such amazing words of kindness. I just don‚Äôt know if I understand the return on investment for all of this. We toil and struggle every single day, fretting and worrying‚Ä¶ for.. what? To have a moment of happiness and so we can accumulate more things? I‚Äôm convinced we are sold that happiness story just so we can continue paying money to people and organizations (I‚Äôm sounding like an absolute whack job. I used to think ‚Äúdo crazy people know they are crazy?‚Äù but as I‚Äôm typing this, I‚Äôm sounding super crazy and would 1,000% believe the person who wrote this is off their rocker. Yet.. here I am. So maybe that‚Äôs it. Maybe I‚Äôm actually crazy?!?). Long story short - I‚Äôm convinced we are forced and shamed to stay alive so we can funnel money to people. Church makes it a sin because if they lose a follower, they lose money (and I‚Äôd bet the whack jobs that write paragraphs like I‚Äôm writing are some of the best folks who give higher share of wallet to church so they‚Äôd be losing a high paying customer). Government is the same way, need the people paying & doing jobs that help the machine run so the high ups get massive amounts of cash. It‚Äôs all money at the end of this- you can‚Äôt take it with you but someone will profit. My crisis is already going to pay out big for like 3 people at least since now I‚Äôm hyper focused on therapy and counseling. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm alive and upright. No one but you knows. It‚Äôs been a year since my last attempt so I‚Äôm betting this one got out the wiggles and it‚Äôll be another year or hopefully more until the next time. I played with my kids this weekend, helped around the house with my wife and put up new crown molding in our bathroom & changed these really high lights in our foyer that I‚Äôve been putting off for months because I needed to get the big ladder out. I‚Äôll keep doing this, keep pretending that this is all normal and has any reason or purpose to it. 

I‚Äôll leave the post as is and walk away - but just wanted to give everyone the update.

My own sister tried to sell me for drugs, yet no one takes me seriously about it. A guy wanted to pay me 10K just to take my virginity away, and she just said ""Omg do it that's so much money! Think about all the pills we could pop!"" And when I speak up about it ""Yeah but you could've gotten high from it too."" I was dying man. I spent 6 days straight on meth not sleeping, not eating. And it's not that I wasn't hungry, but my mom was too busy doing coke herself at her boyfriend's house that she couldn't be bothered sending us 10$ to atleast get bread or soup.
I wanna be like the other 15yo girls, but I'll never be. 'Cause I'm not even a girl anymore. Just some kind of experiment for the others to enjoy...

But that's nothing? Dude if it gets any worse when I grow up, might as well end it all now.
I'm tired of surviving and for what?...I just wanna live.

u/xAnakin_Skywalkerx,216,"48 hours to go  So yesterday I went to Walmart and successfully bought a bottle of Ibuprofen without my mom finding out. It‚Äôs currently hidden in a drawer in my room. On Tuesday after I get home from morning tutoring, I am going to take the entire bottle. It‚Äôs 100 200mg pills, so it‚Äôll be 20,000mg of ibuprofen at once. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going to happen, and a large part of me is terrified, but I know that this needs to happen. 

I mainly hate lying to my mom. That entire time we were at Walmart yesterday, I had the bottle hidden in my purse and I just felt awful having to act like nothing was wrong the rest of the day. Then at work last night I had absolutely no motivation, and I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt again tonight. I hate having to act happy today, since it‚Äôs Easter. I wish I could tell my mom she didn‚Äôt have to buy all that candy, because I‚Äôll never get a chance to eat it. 

A lot of you think I should stay for my mom, and well, I understand why, but I‚Äôve been doing that for the past 8 years, and nothing has gotten better for me. I‚Äôm sick and tired of waiting and waiting for things to change, but they never seem to do. The worst part about this is doing this to her, because the last thing I want to do is put my pain on her. But at the same time I feel I‚Äôve run out of options. Maybe it‚Äôs selfish, well, it is selfish. But I‚Äôve always been a selfless person, so why can‚Äôt I be selfish for one time in my life? All I can do is hope she‚Äôll be okay in the long run. She has my brother, her sister, her mom. She has people that I know will support her through this and give her a reason to keep going. Just like she did for me these past 8 years. 

Also, to the people saying it‚Äôs not worth it because of the agony it may put me through, I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm in enough mental agony that physical won‚Äôt even be much harder. And at least for that time I‚Äôll be focused on that instead of my dark thoughts. And if I live, and it messes my body up, I mean, my mind is already messed up, so what‚Äôs so bad about my body getting messed up, too? Not like I have a good life ahead of me, if any.

We shared all our values and life goals, we wanted a family and children. We wanted to see the world and build careers that would let us make a difference. 

She wanted to help victims of violent crimes, she had endless empathy for people and the courage to try to empower those who had suffered from the most horrific crimes.

She followed me from our home in Helsinki to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania where I got a job soon after our wedding. We loved our lives there. She was blossoming, made the sweetest friends, and was working the perfect job that allowed her to work remotely while I worked my office job.

9th August 2024 she falls ill, I figure it's just a flu as I had one too and she tends to always get hit by the flu harder than me. For a full 24 hours I just take care of her at home, thinking rest is all she needs. The next day she is delirious, I still think this might just be a combo of the flu and the aural migraines she would often get. We get to the hospital around midday. It's malaria. I still think: ""they know exactly how to treat malaria here, she'll be just fine""

2 weeks of fighting, complication after complication. On the 24th of August 2024, at 9AM, the doctors tell us her brain herniated, she was brain dead. The next 16 hours we watched her body give up. We were sobbing, sleeping and staring into the void over what was basically already a corpse being kept ""alive"" by tubes and medication. Tanzanian law would not allow her to be unplugged at the moment of brain death. 25th August 3AM, she is pronounced dead.

I'm back in Finland now at my parents' house. I have barely left my childhood bedroom. I dont have a home anymore. I lost my best friend, my first and only love, my future.

I'm in agony, the memories of our life together and her tubed corpse swirling in my head. I dont know how to live without her, I dont know how to function. I feel so alone, despite family and friends trying to be there for me.

I would not want to live, but I cant hurt my family more than they are already hurting. They loved her like a daughter.

I just want my home back, I want to be loved like she loved me.

u/zaza_1315,247,"I hate that I can't kill myself I have come to the conclusion I can't kill myself and I hate it. I just can't bring myself to because of my family and honestly I'm a coward. I don't even know the reason I wake up everyday,I am numb. I feel that my life is going nowhere. I have no reason to look forward to starting my day. Everyone of my ""friends"" always leave me and start distancing themselves from me. I hate everything about me.",u/zaza_1315,3,"Fr like I could never go through with it knowing the pain my family would have to go through after it,I know my mom would never recover and I could never make her go through that,no matter how I feel and my mental health state | Please don't do it,I know this sounds ironic considering what I posted but focus on loving yourself and loving what you see and the rest will fall in place. | Have you ever thought that failure is the first step to success?I mean success isn't only limited to one meaning anyway,it differs from one person to another. So take your little achievements in your day to day life and be proud of them. Look man I don't know you personally but I can tell deep down you want to get better. Idk what your dealing with but if it all becomes too much you might want to seek a therapist or someone to help. Even telling your parents just so that they know you are struggling and can help a bit,and that way you are surrounded by support and love.(I'm one to talk lol,but honestly I can't stand having anyone but me having such thoughts because I know I can handle it)",1cav7fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cav7fl/i_hate_that_i_cant_kill_myself/,-0.9990986585617065,-0.9195343255996704,0.07956433296203613,neutral
