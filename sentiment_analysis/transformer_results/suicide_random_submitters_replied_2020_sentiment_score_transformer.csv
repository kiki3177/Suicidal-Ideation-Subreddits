u/No_Tomorrow_8685,42,"I hate my race  

I don't know where else to talk about this.. I hate my own race. Only recently I found out it's called Internalized Racism. I blame it on the religion ruining everything.

""We're a retarded backward hypocritical inhumane race.. we're losers."" I blame Islam and whoever made sure to implement it and keep it going for political reasons.. the brainwashing.. the idiocity.

My own people make me ashamed! They're an embarrassment, wherever they go! It's because of their undeserved and illogical pride of being f\*cking Muslims and the chosen people for speaking the holy language of the holy Quran.

They think they're special. Chosen. Lucky.

The entire Arab race disgusts me.

Why did we have to have this dry, extreme, and invasive religion..

I'm in love with this amazing western man. But I'm afraid of having kids. I don't want to pass my genes, culture, or make little beings join a game of ""we're muslims okay?"".. what am I supposed to tell them? ""We claim we're muslims so dad could marry me! we have to pretend we're still muslims because we don't wanna get killed""??

What if they sense my racism and hatred? What if I alter their sense of self? What if I damage them by mistake..? What if I cause them an identity crisis?

I'm sorry if this is boring and/or irrelevant.

I think I'm looking for.. similarity? I just want to get it out of my mind. Do I even make any sense...

Tldr; I hate my own \[Arab\] race because of how influenced my people and my culture are by Islam. I found out that's called Internalized Racism. I'm scared of having kids and passing my inferior genes and cluture and having to lie about their religion for our safety.",u/No_Tomorrow_8685,3,"I feel like all Arabs are are bad even me | You never lived in arab counrty so you wouldn't how cancerous are arabs | &gt; I love the genuine humanity arabs have for one another

they don't have humanity 

&gt; If you live in the west you may have internalized some racism from the media. Arabs are.... Just like every other race. Arabic culture is similar to many MANY other cultures.

i think the reason why i have internalized racism is because of r/exmuslim, they talk shit about arabs like if we are savages and i feel like they saying the truth | &gt; Every culture has the good and the bad

I hate everything about arab culture even the food,the art,the music, the dresses and the languages

&gt;Get off that sub and read about the beautiful things Arabs did.

there is nothing beautiful that arabs did,all arabs did was slavery,rape,imperialism,genocide and honor killings, yes every nation did it but arabs did it in the worst way possible, arabs are good destorying things not creating things | most people on that sub are not westerns

u/NoahLutzke,2,"I realized that I haven't been happy for over half of my life now I haven't really talked to anyone about my depression before, and I honestly think it's long overdue. As of writing this I just tried hanging myself about 10 minutes ago, but obviously it didn't work out. I guess I should tell people why I've been depressed for so long. It began after my parents got divorced when I was seven. My mother cheated on my dad and after my dad found out he beat and raped her. After witnessing that I became much more quiet and introverted. To this day I've never even spent the night at someone else's house who wasn't a family member. My mom is still with the man she cheated on my dad with (He is now my step dad.) and I despised him for a very long time. He treated me very poorly and would make me feel like I was going to end up like my dad. We do have a slightly better relationship now I guess, but it still doesn't change how he treated me. Throughout the last 7 years I have grown very close to my cousins. They are basically like siblings to me. Sadly at the beginning of this year one passed away due to suicide. He introduced me to so many of my passions and without him I think I would have killed myself a long time ago.  This made me realize that for the most part I haven't been happy for the majority of my life now. My parents got divorced in the summer of 2013. Now I'm twice as old as I was back then, and things have only gotten worse. I've really only had one friend before and I only new for the school year of 5th grade. I've been homeschooled for the past 3 years now. I was going to go back to public school this year but then the coronavirus stuff happened. I think something that would help me is if I found a hobby that I enjoyed. I used to draw a lot but I only did it so my parents thought I was doing something with my life. Another thing that made me depressed when I was younger is how my sister would treat me. I absolutely love my sister, but there was a time where I genuinely thought she hated me. My sister and my grandma were the only people I tried to talk about my issues with, but my sister would say I was only talking about it for attention. This made me feel like I wasn't allowed to be serious with anyone, so when I'm around people I just make jokes the entire time. My sister treats me great now though. I'm sorry for the long post, but I had to vent somehow. (By the way, I know I made my dad sound like a terrible person. While what he did was awful, I will always love him and he has always tried his best to make me happy.)",u/NoahLutzke,1,"Thank you for commenting, and yes I feel a lot better getting that off of my chest.

The next date on the calendar that I get to see them is what made me the happiest person in the world. My therapist says I suffer from grief over losing someone I truly loved.

My partner cheated on me. It‚Äôs almost been a year and I told myself I couldn‚Äôt give up until the one year anniversary of her cheating on me.

That‚Äôs the only date that I look forward to anymore. The day I get to end it all",u/NoreasonThrowawayacc,1,"It sucks shit | I‚Äôm also on the same position. It‚Äôs kinda fucked too cause I found that I‚Äôm only really attracted to people who like me, so I find it hard to even fall in love with other people. I have that same feeling that I just don‚Äôt even want to try anymore. It slams even harder when I think that I‚Äôll never feel ok | I don‚Äôt want to bother my friends. I‚Äôve tried therapy, I‚Äôve tried talking about my depression with my friends, I‚Äôve tried to talk to my parents. I can‚Äôt find happiness. I waste their time and bring them down. No one wants to be around someone who‚Äôs depressed | Because my friends see how lost I am, they try to help but at the end of the day I just talk for too long and still feel terrible.

Happiness for me is being with someone who genuinely cares about me and me for them. If I was happy I would look forward to the next day.

Therapy was helpful but it‚Äôs expensive and doesn‚Äôt solve my underlying problem that I‚Äôm lonely and genuinely believe that nobody will ever love me for me | They listen to me and talk and help me get away from negative reactions. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck and never going to get better.

I wouldn‚Äôt be like if I had someone like that. That‚Äôs my problem.

My previous and first girlfriend and only person who has ever shown me romantic interest cheated on me, broke up with me and then let me figure out what she did | Sorry I was busy.

Now I‚Äôve talked to them enough that I feel like I‚Äôm rehashing old material that I‚Äôm still not over. I‚Äôm stuck because I‚Äôm miserable and I don‚Äôt believe and I can anything to remedy the situation. I don‚Äôt want to try really hard and fake my way into a shitty relationship, I want to love someone and that someone to love me back.

My feeling come from inadequacy generated from my previous relationship. I have no evidence that anyone loves me. I want to feel like what I felt before. I‚Äôm starving for physical and romantic affection.

I‚Äôve tried dating apps, I‚Äôve tried being slightly more forward. I get no signals that anyone is interested. All my friends either have boyfriends or get hit on or got boyfriends during the last year. All I ever do is study and do class work. I cram ever last second of my week doing work so that I don‚Äôt have to think about how lonely I am. Nobody wants me which is clear through speaking with people, my friends say that I am desirable but it‚Äôs not like I can believe them because if I was undesirable they would lie. I‚Äôm an emotional wreak and I think about killing myself daily, who the fuck would date that. | I feel like since I can‚Äôt receive closure on my relationship and keep talking about the same sad things with my friends. It doesn‚Äôt make me feel any better and I feel like I‚Äôm annoying my friends.

When my partner cheated and then broke up with me, I was sad. I attempted to find someone else who could make me feel happy and someone I could make happy too. Through chatting with people, dating apps, etc. I found that people are not interested in me, at least no where to the same magnitude as any of my friends. All my friends have boyfriends or easily find people to date who like them. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm intimidating or ugly or unapproachable. The fact that I was dropped for someone else and that no one wants me even now demonstrates the cause for my feeling of inadequacy.

I would feel that when you are talking to a friend who is depressed and they talk about how they are terrible and how no one likes them, then you would normally say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, you‚Äôre not ugly, you‚Äôre awesome‚Äù etc. etc. If I was all the terrible things that I think I am they wouldn‚Äôt tell me the truth, but if I was beautiful and amazing they would also say the same thing. No matter what I am they would most likely compliment me.

It‚Äôs been so long now that I am genuinely dead inside. I gleam happiness and humor when talking to people but I don‚Äôt ever feel happy. It‚Äôs all an act so that they don‚Äôt know that I hurt myself and wish that I was dead. I am not going to be loved. Fuck this place. I wish I died the moment she broke up with me. I got the date, I‚Äôm just waiting to lose the last sliver of hope. | I mean that she left me without giving an explanation and out of the blue. I asked her what I did wrong or what was wrong with me but she couldn‚Äôt give me a direct or informative answer. From my understanding of the situation she just found someone better. I‚Äôve analyzed my behavior, my actions towards her and I thought that I was extremely nice. I was never mean to her nor knocked her down, I treated her with respect and loved her. I asked her about her day chatted with her daily on the phone etc. All while being relatively enthusiastic. This type of grief does not have closure. Because I can‚Äôt get an answer to my internal questions I rehash the same things with friends when I‚Äôm sad. Nobody ever asks me how I feel, what I really feel. Everyone acts like everything is ok, I never want to talk about it because I know they‚Äôll just be a blank reflecting board. If they don‚Äôt bring it up or genuinely sit me down to ask me what‚Äôs going on, they see the bruises on my arms and assume it‚Äôs something else or ignore it.

I am so physically and emotionally romantically deprived that I don‚Äôt ever feel good anymore. Everyone always says depression is like feeling lost but it doesn‚Äôt encapsulated the feeling of being hollow. I want someone who genuinely cares about me but who I also love physically. I go weeks realizing that I haven‚Äôt touched another person. I know exactly what complete happiness felt like and I had it. I was completely unworried and in total trust of my partner, I could tell them anything and they would love me. And this was all true the other way around. I want to be able to be a shoulder they can lean on. I also just miss the feeling of being cuddled by someone you love. These problems are caused by the trauma sustained from the previous relationship I don‚Äôt even genuinely believe that I‚Äôm fixable anymore.

What I mean by the truth is that I want to know what is wrong with me that makes it so that people don‚Äôt want to be with me. There most likely isn‚Äôt an answer.

If I don‚Äôt pretend to be mentally healthy, if I appear sad most of the time, if I seem broken or depressed or damaged then no one will want me. I already have no one wanting me when I was relatively intact so being sad doesn‚Äôt improve my odds. I also heavily care about my friends and don‚Äôt want to make them feel bad or burden them with my problems so I hide my pain.

The thing that screws me the most is the thought that no one cares about me and that people only want me here for themselves. My friends don‚Äôt genuinely ask how I‚Äôm doing, if I ever mention that I hurt myself or that I want to kill myself the only response I get is that they would be very sad. To me this is a burden of guilt, I want to so badly kill myself but I can‚Äôt do it, I suffer and it seems like the only reason anyone ever cares is that because if I was gone then they would feel sad. Well what about me! I spend my whole relationship trying to be the best partner I could ever be and what do I get! Cheated on! I finally started caring how I feel and now I know that I feeling fucking terrible all the time. I, want, it, to, end.

I even mentioned in my last post that I have a date for it too. I just get ignored or trivialized. Nobody mentions my bruises, nobody asks me if I‚Äôm thinking about killing myself, nobody wants to see how I feel. I find it sad that if I killed myself tomorrow it would probably be a shock to everyone, ‚ÄúBut he was always so happy‚Äù they would say | I fundamentally do not believe there is an answer to the question, ‚Äúwhat was wrong with me?‚Äù Because I‚Äôve come to realize that it wasn‚Äôt me at least on the part of being a good partner. She found someone better, or someone that she liked more. She stopped giving a fuck about me and didn‚Äôt bother to think about how her actions would make me feel. I want to know what I could of done to keep my happiness but the problem is that is was going to be gone anyway.

You know what feeling good feels like, that warmth, that rush of dopamine, that nice feeling in your core, that excitement you get, the smile that grows on your face. Hollow means that I don‚Äôt get that shit anymore, I could get a 100% on an exam and I wouldn‚Äôt give a fuck. Nothing feels good anymore.

I can understand that when you have a friend that is going through some things and they just don‚Äôt get over it, that sometimes when that friend asks you for help or is down all the time, sometimes they can bring down your mood. Especially when I‚Äôm normally just as depressed after talking to them as before.

They can‚Äôt. I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough because the only person that romantically loved me dropped me for another guy. They can‚Äôt help with that feeling of inadequacy. I‚Äôm going to live with that for the rest of my short life. I thought they could help me before but now I know nothing will fix the hole she left. They could at least give me a reason other than, ‚ÄúI would be sad‚Äù, ‚Äúyour family would be sad‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt gets better‚Äù, because I don‚Äôt believe for a moment that things are going to get better. The first two just make it seem like it‚Äôs ok to keep living even though you‚Äôre in pain every second because other people need me. I thought I had someone who needed me, but it turns out she does plenty fine with some other cunt.

When someone asks, ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù they don‚Äôt give a fuck how you are they are just opening a conversation. When I start saying things like, ‚ÄúIm never happy‚Äù or ‚ÄúI want to kill myself‚Äù or ‚ÄúI hurt myself‚Äù it would seems like an appropriate response to pull me aside and ask me heart to heart is everything is ok. If it‚Äôs not ok, then to ask what they can do. If you see bruises on somebody‚Äôs arm, ask if they‚Äôre ok.

I can probably tell that you keep asking questions to help me get through this but I don‚Äôt think this has an end. I just keep going in circles about how nothing ever feels good and no one loves me. I feel like a whiny asshole, who the fuck cares if I want to kill myself. I‚Äôve done a pretty fucking good job at convincing myself that nothing will ever feel good again and that I should end it all. Your questions are probably there just to stall me anyway. I‚Äôm so fucking tired of hating myself and nothing feeling good. I‚Äôm done with this shit world, I tried to be the nicest kindest person I could be but all it did was spit in my face. Fuck this shit, my only regret is that I didn‚Äôt end it all sooner so save myself some pain | Why do you give a damn about me? Why are you talking to me? Why do you ask me so many questions? Why is it that whenever I look for help it never helps, it never has. Why can no one help me? Why does no one love me? Why do I want to kill myself so much but I can‚Äôt do it? | It‚Äôs the worst I‚Äôve ever been I just want to end it | Ex cheated on me. The regular bullshit that everyone can handle. Been alone for a while now and everything hurts, I am unloveable. I‚Äôve heard all the usual hopeful bs over and over again but nothing ever feels good. There‚Äôs only pain and sadness.

u/North-Technician,3,"Hail Mary pass (ironically) The Church says it's a mortal sin. I know it's a selfish act but living has been suffering and fear and shame for years now. I have self-talked myself into near insanity, I've kept going/trying/hoping but hope deferred makes the heart grow sick. As Red said, ""Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane."" I have utterly failed in my life. A lot of it is my fault, a lot isn't. I was thinking that going by infection would hide the act but suddenly leaving and then not seeking medical help would be, at least, odd. It would hurt my mother, I know, even if she didn't think it was a suicide, which she would torture herself wondering. That is an issue for me. Her waking up every day with that loss and those questions would be a cruelty. Yet another of a seemingly endless list of misdeeds I'm nearly famous for. But I know I'm seriously considering it because it scares me yet I continue to plan. I would have to leave home to seek out infection and then not return, of course, to protect the family. I would have to find a location, fill the gas tank, etc. first to minimize transmission. I would have to isolate somewhere for, I'm guessing a good month+. I can isolate in a hotel/motel but I don't think I could afford that long at 40-80+ a night (not even thinking about food).

u/idkmanthatstheissue,2,"I want to die I don't know how to do this since it's my first time posting on Reddit but... Yeah title says it all. I had planned on making a big detailed post with all aspects of my life but as many of the stuff I think of doing I just never got to do it.

Well let's see. I'm a 24 years old white male who hates how I look. I am also gay (as far as my chaotic uncertainty let's me assume) and my sexuality is part of the mess that brings me here. As much as I watch and read about the lgbtq+ community and consciously acknowledge and learn, deep inside there's disgusting self-hatred unacceptance. That might be tied to the rejection of my parents when I came out to them. As a result of that situation we just live as that never happened.

I am ""so smart and have such a bright future ahead of me"" but since before high school I've had a grim view of the future as studying until I get a job, working until I can't work anymore and then hope to survive with what I get for the rest of my life for the work I've done. That let to me being completely closed to academics in a way that I just did it for my parents and because I didn't want to go through a school year all over again. I've graduated college in 2018 in a major I had no interest in just for the sake of graduating college (don't worry, student loans aren't a thing here) and have been doing nothing for a whole year by now.

I am a big fan of games and music, in general. I made some friends through middle school that I still have and even made different friends meet each other and become friends. Now I see them working/looking for jobs, dating and completely interested in something I dislike and just like that I'm feeling completely lonely. About music, I became interested in singing mid teen years and had around 5 years of classes. My lack of control over my own body meant I actually damaged my vocal chords and somehow my chest by not doing the techniques properly.

Speaking of my body, my knees have been bad for years now and doctors didn't say much. I tried working out to make me feel better about myself and it resulted in my knees constantly hurting, my elbows (that didn't use to hurt) hurting months after stopping to work out and my back hurting. I also have some sort of tendinitis on my hands that I never brought up to anyone. Added to that, I took a benign tumor out of the right side of my jaw and I still can't open my mouth as wide as I feel like (which apparently is normal even over a year after the surgery). These and some minor other stuff bring me back to the reality that I'll never be comfortable either physically or mentally with my body.

Behavior wise, I am extremely irritable but don't let it out at anyone who doesn't live with me, but I never physically attack anyone. I hate last minute plans most of the time and I hate people invading my space, even more so touching me. My stomach often spasms if someone touches it. I love being in the dark in my house and I love being away from people almost 100% of the time. I also hate how hard it is to understand and deal with people. Feelings are easily hurt before I even realize and it mostly feels like walking in a minefield which I frequently forget it is like that. I hate dealing with many people, specifically if I am not ""interested"" in them in particular. Malls, theaters and stuff don't bother me since those people have no intention on interacting between groups of people. I recently started feeling empty at random moments of random days. It's like there's an actual void inside my chest and it feels very suffocating (which is contradictory). I take pills daily as a recommendation from my psychiatrist. I've forced myself to seek a therapist around 5 times in my life with years of build up from each attempt. At the 3rd time I started having sessions for around 8 months. I was then asked to stop going back by my therapist who said I am manipulative, compared myself to my friends after saying I shouldn't compare myself to them, frequently told me how tiresome it was to have sessions with me and said I disrespected her in every way possible (while I was completely unaware of every single moment I allegedly did). Since then I had 2 more attempts that I dropped and now have no therapist for almost a year now.

Too much, I know. Thing is, I can't see a future for myself. It's impossible to relate to any idea of me succeeding in any way in the future. I can't see myself happy, I can't see myself content with the job I have, I can't see myself in a loving relationship (heck I haven't even kissed anyone in my life). I absolutely despise my appearance even though it's most likely at least average. I actively sabotage my health in tiny ways such as not seeking doctors about things I feel, not sleeping well enough, not eating healthy. In my mind those are ways for me to guarantee some sort of condition will show up in the future so I can never possibly live comfortably in the future and thus reach a point where I can finally die, since I've never had the courage to do it.

Again, sorry. Too much. No idea how much of it has any relation to how I feel and how many loose ends I left in anything I said.",u/idkmanthatstheissue,1,"It's good enough to know someone cared enough to read it I guess. I've already partially detached to the sensation I was feeling when I typed that (which is also a thing that I do) but still... Yeah. About the points in particular:
1) I consciously know that it's okay to be part of the lgbtq+ community in any way but... Something inside me doesn't collaborate no matter how hard I'd want it to. I feel like there are things about my life I haven't understood yet that would help me overcome some of my obstacles. About being me that's... Also an obstacle. I was exposed a good amount of times to situations where I had to express myself/define myself in any way and.... I can't. Idk who I am, thus my username. Idk how I want to express myself, look, behave I... Just don't know.
2) That's unfortunate... It's nice to know you could find it in online friends a way to deal with that. What particularly sucks is that my therapist started treating all my friends and then she starts criticizing me in relation to them...? Not to mention the intimidation based relation she worked with me due to the possibility of me reacting with sarcasm to questions as a defense mechanism. In particular, the manipulative thing it kind of tears me apart. It makes me feel absolutely disgusting as a person and that anything I do if I have that in mind at that moment could be me trying to manipulate someone.
3) I know that I can do most things daily without much effort but those feel like a reminder that ""I was being too naive for feeling good about something"", considering those will come back to haunt me and remind me I'm not alright physically (and then remind me that not mentally either)
4) My mom wants to be affectionate by being touchy (not inappropriately, god no) and I don't react well. And there's also my little sister which really doesn't stop getting in my personal space, from taking over space in my room (which ticks me because I don't want things to change from how I'm feeling comfortable at the moment) by lying in my bed when I want to or even by lying/sitting right next to me, touching arms, legs, hair on me which all bothers me. The worst about that in particular is that she feels like I don't like her because I don't want her to be touching me or taking over my space (she even cried today apparently because of me, and it's probably related to that) | She was actually the one who took my friend from deep depression, having attempted several times and got him to move forward to the point of graduating college, starting to work and getting a girlfriend. It reinforces that thing I always have in my mind that I am always gonna be the one that can't overcome something everyone does or do whatever thing everyone is capable of. Well... She's in the past though so... Yeah. I understand where you're coming from with your rant I'd hope people would always find a place of comfort and support in therapy sessions but that unfortunately can't be the case. The physical stuff would mostly not bother me if it didn't get in the way of me playing games/using my phone sometimes (basically the only thing I do all day) and of me trying to get in a shape I'd hope I'd feel comfortable in (I've actually recently lost a lot of weight due to the medicine I'm taking and got out of overweight territory but still hate how my stomach looks, most of all). But you're right, we can actually live with that be it however it is. The personal space stuff I can relate but it's... Complicated for me. I am completely unpredictable. Sometimes I won't mind letting people approach me and touching me anyway to show their affection and sometimes I absolutely hate it, and there's basically no telling for people when is when. I even love getting hugs from my older brother because he's always away since he lives in another state now.

Lastly I just... Realized it kind of looks like I am trying to one-up you on how I feel about things. I swear I don't think I have it worse or anything it's just... Me bringing out the stuff that I'm feeling I guess? I suppose I for some reason wanted to mention what I think and feel about things in my life. In more important matters, I hope people do get to a point where they get the hint that you don't want them touching you | It's a relief to know you don't mind, then.

Well I eat incredibly unhealthy and don't do any exercises... I actually only lost weight because of the medicine I take for my dysthymia.

I would talk to a doctor about them but it's a mix of me not wanting to acknowledge them/me wanting them to get bad so I can feel worse about them. I hope you afford the surgery for your mom soon though.

that‚Äôs why i decided to post here, because for some reason it seems more comforting to have all my worries and everything expressed to a stranger online who (i hope) won‚Äôt judge what i say, and won‚Äôt know anything about me beforehand or while reading this.

lately i‚Äôve been having so many intrusive thoughts, i can‚Äôt help but think about killing myself. it‚Äôs on the daily and i can‚Äôt make it stop, and it just hurts so bad. i get chest pains a lot while running through scenarios in my head, i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs from anxiety or what, as i have had anxiety attacks a decent amount before. i‚Äôm just tired of everything, and i don‚Äôt know how much more i can handle before i break completely. the other issue is i have absolutely no plan for my life, j feel like highschool ending also marks the end of my journey here, i don‚Äôt have any other reason to be alive anymore. i‚Äôm not happy, i‚Äôm constantly tired, and i just know my friends are getting tired of me being bitchy around them but i just can‚Äôt help it. i put up this happy cheery face at work and i just can‚Äôt hold it up anymore once i‚Äôm home. my mom stopped ending her texts with ‚Äúi love you‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt say it on phone calls anymore, even though i know i brought that on myself. i don‚Äôt see her anymore, i never said it back in the first place. she had no reason to love me. i genuinely think she‚Äôs starting to hate me but i‚Äôm too scared to see her again. i love her more than anything but for some reason i just can‚Äôt seem to express it to her, and that hurts so bad.

i can‚Äôt stop thinking about ending it, i have suicide notes written in my notes app, and i‚Äôve already planned how to do it. now i just wait for the day i finally have enough and snap. or maybe something will happen and god will do me a favour.

honestly just writing this out with the hopes that someone will see it and know how i‚Äôm feeling, even if no one does, i think i might start writing these often. i think this helped.

after that i just deleted discord out of embarrassment and went to sleep. now in the morning i feel really energized and kinda happy even. this happens EVERY TIME. my mood swings so fast from me being about to strangle myself to feeling perfectly okay. i feel like im faking these feelings but im clearly not because i already attempted to hang myself like twice

its so embarrassing to come back from those giant vents while feeling fine. i feel like a faker who wasted everyones time, sort of like a boy who cried wolf situation. is this normal to still be happy a lot of the time? this sort of thing has been happening to me for like the past week. i usually only get really suicidal at night but lately ive started having thoughts later in the afternoon too

(unfortunately, i dont have any irl friends, but im working on it)

i do agree i love talking with people and just being in other's presence and usually when i get off a voice call or something with my friends i feel a lot more energized and happy

u/idontknow212121,1,"I‚Äòm so scared for the coming winter because of the last two years I‚Äòm female and 18 years old. Two years ago my grandmother/ best friend died on december 21th 2018. My world fell apart and I started having dreams about her and had breakdowns regularly. It was bad.

I think the following summer (2019) I felt okay but my eating habits and weed consumption got very bad. I broke up with my boyfriend because I felt trapped. A few month went by and I missed him like hell because he actually wasn‚Äòt the reason I felt trapped. I had panic attacks and sleepless nights. Everyday I got high trying to feel better. I just wanted to die at that point. There was not one day I didn‚Äòt think about dying. 

So I went to a therapist and actually felt better about my grandma. My boyfriend and I got back together and everything was fine.

Now summer is ending slowly and I feel trapped again. I don‚Äòt see a future that seems nice. I‚Äòm so afraid I will be as miserable as I was last year when the cold months are coming by. But on the other side I just want everything to end.

Basically, a friend of mine has been threatening to commit suicide and self-multilate for the past 3 months. Even after getting medical help, he just seems to get worse. He‚Äôs highly unstable and even though all the people in my social circle, including my therapist, tell me to stay away from him, tell me he‚Äôs manipulating me into feeling bad for him, I can‚Äôt cut 100% contact with him, because we never know when is he going to snap and do something extreme, and he‚Äôll try to reach out for me and I won‚Äôt be there.

I know whenever he willingly reaches out to me he‚Äôs up to something. And whenever he sends me any kind of photo or video of himself it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs about to do something I can‚Äôt stop him from doing. First time it happened i called him and told him to just leave the knife on the kitchen drawer. It worked somehow. Second time I threatened to block him (i sound like an asshole but there‚Äôs a LOT of details behind that. I might get into them later in another post). It worked somehow.

u/idontplanonreplying,7,"They say that killing yourself is selfish but i think its the most selfless act one can do. Making the final choice in your own life. In the span of a year i was the department manager of pharmacy at walmart during covid. I was screamed at, spit on, called every name in the book and i still made it. Somewhat. I was hospitalized for the 6th time in my life during this. I remember siting in a room with other hospitalized people watching trump announce the national emergency for covid19. They tried to change my medications to the bare basics. They took away the mood stabilizers that i desperately needed. I'm bipolar 2, i need these medications. The sudden change because the made me quit cold Turkey made me go into a manic state and i stayed in longer. I was finally released and went straight back to work. Back to screaming from Karen's about wheres the zinc, vitamin c, emergen-c, the fucking elder berry. But i followed the the advice from one of the guys from the hospital. Make a mask. When i was at the hospital i couldnt sleep, neither could he so we would sit in the lounge area and talk. And he taught me how to make a mask. We trained on it, he taught me how to speak right and smile right so that no one would guess about how much i wanted to die. So i used that mask and no one knew. The managers said i was probably one of the happiest associates and i always got good reviews from cosutmers. I hated them all. I felt management was pathetic and the customers had literally one brain cell between all of them. And most of the time that brain cell was asleep at the wheel.
 I worked hard, i put blood sweat and tears into that department and then in October i was told about great work place. Management restructure. My job was eliminated. I was given the option of going to cap 1 or cap 2. They're stocking positions. I was a department manager and i get to go and be a stocker. üôÉ i managed to snag a position in another and the manager in charge of that didn't even want me. Made every excuse on the book to not let me in. The final one he could get on was. ""You're too close to the guys in the department."" What foes he think I'm fucking them? I've worked with these guys for more than a year before i was in pharmacy, of course I'm fucking close to them. He made my life hell he set me up for failure. I could never do anything right. And everytime it was my fault. I didn't ask for help. I did no one responded. I didn't finish the task. The task you gave me takes at least 3 hours to complete and you gave me one. I went to ethics. And o was moved out of the department, i was back in pharmacy. All the work i did for electronics, i completely fixed their backroom, their security room ext. I knew their inventory like the back of my hand. And he took all my work from me. 
I get to wear a mask in pharmacy again and make people think i like them and that i care about their dick problems. But I'm done. Medications aren't working, therapy is worthless. And all I'm doing is making everyone's life a living hell. I'm not living, I'm existing. And i can't live this way anymore. 

I always had this was of explaining my life and depression to my therapist. I'm at the bottom of a lake, i can hear muffled sounds from above but I'm just sitting there watching the fish go by. They have purpose but i never figured out mine. Then sometimes ill hear a voice screaming my name, telling me to come up. Or sometimes I'm swimming in the depths and find where its going to the shore. I follow the voice and i try to swim to the top but when i get there there's ice. Its clear and really thick but i see them, the people yelling. They tell me to break through and that they love me. But i can't break through its too thick and i can't breathe. And I'm too scared. But i can break the ice for awhile and fake it on the surface but i don't belong on the surface. I don't belong to happy people when all I want is to go back to my lake and drown. So i run back and swim to the bottom and hide again. 

Jumping in the lake again to me is me putting my mask back on and hiding how i feel. How i feel that i want to die. 

So i have a plan, I'm done with life and I'm done with my life hurting others. One January 2nd i plan on ending my life. Due to being in Pharmacy i was able to get all of pain pills that went on clearance, i have 7 bottles of 650mg 24count tylenol. From a surgery i had i have 4 800mg motrin. 3 bottles of 200mg motrin 40 count. All of these easy to swallow pills. I have ambien 10mg 30 count. Lithium 200mg 60 count. Lamictal 200mg 60 count. Venfluxitin 35.7 mg 60 count. Gabapentin 300mg 60 count (x2).
6 bottles of vodka to choice from, and about 9 other types of alcohol. I plan to slit my wrist with the bowie knife i keep by me bed. And to end it all off I've got an edible that will completely knock me out. I'm ready to go. I've learned in life some people aren't meant to be happy. If i die people in my life will be better off. They'll hurt for awhile but I've gone to every church, mosque, temple, ect and asked all of those gods and goddesses to protect my family and give them peace. Its all i can do.

u/iforgotmysquid,41,"I have a thin penis and I am close to giving up I don't know if this should be tagged as NSFW or not and i'm sorry for the length.

I'm 23 years old, and a virgin. I am probably of average looks and am fairly tall at 6""2'. I have a skinny build. I was actually okay with my body until I learned my penis is very thin.

My length when fully aroused is 6 inches, which is fine, but my girth is only 4.1 inches, and that's at full arousal. I have seen so many posts on Reddit and on other sites, videos, and articles, where women say that size doesn't matter and that girth is more important. I have seen many posts from women who say that having sex with someone who has a thin dick is an awful experience, and some posts where women were disgusted when they discovered that their partner had a thin penis.

A few hours ago I came across a website where you could type in your dick measurements and see how many men would have larger/smaller measurements than you. I typed in my girth measurements and out of 1000 men, over 850 would have a thicker penis. That was crushing.

I could be a god at foreplay and eating a woman out, but it would never make up for a thin dick. I could do my best and work with angles to try to hit her vaginal walls, but it wouldn't be the same as having sex with a thicker dick. I keep seeing posts where relationships fall apart because the mans dick just isn't good enough, and the woman fakes pleasure because she feels bad about it. She can't feel it.

I don't want that to happen. I want to fulfill my hypothetical womans sexual desires. For the vast majority of women, I will not be enough. Even with toys, it simply isn't the same as an average or above sized real penis. I don't want her to have to dream about being sexually satisfied. I want to love her and make her feel sexually whole.

I know every woman is different, and that the same applies to their vaginas, but the odds of me finding someone who would be a good fit for me is so low that I see no reason to even look.

I've heard there are 3 billion women in the world (that sounds like an out of date stat but lets roll with it for a second). How many women are in my part of the world? Now how many are single? How many are attracted to me? How many am I attracted to? How many would actually be okay with a smaller girth? The numbers are far from in my favour.

I feel unfuckable and unloveable. I'm beginning to give up. The only thing that has really kept me hopeful was that one day I could find the courage to fix myself (garbage family life, highly depressed  even before discovering my size problem) and one day share a happy life with a woman that I cared for, and who cared for me. I can't see that happening now, especially with my newfound insecurities.

Sex isn't everything in a relationship, but if it's bad then it's everything.

I recently read an article of an 18 year old guy who killed himself because he had a small penis, and I can see myself in that article. Since I found out my dick is smaller I've tried to just acknowledge it and keep going, but I can't. It's always in my head. I can no longer watch porn because I usually imagine myself as the guy, but I can't see myself pleasuring anyone. Even solo female videos are kind of hard to watch because I imagine her having that awful feeling of pity/unsatisfaction.

I've been on anti-depressants, but even with those the thought of just killing myself is always there. Always. I have no one to turn to, I am lonely, disgusting, and I'm running out of road to ride on. I want to take a bottle of pills and never wake up. I want to shoot myself in the stomach and then the head. I want to feel pain because I feel like it would justify the way I feel inside. But I haven't done anything yet. I put a knife to my throat and held it there trying to hype myself up to cutting a major artery, but I couldn't do it. I feel like a coward. 

I don't think I violated any rules by posting this but if I did then i'm sorry mods.

Sometimes I think about it but decide against it, kind of like i'm punishing myself. It gets easier the longer I go without. Have you been feeling negative for long? It's been over 5 years for me. The revelation of my size was the tipping point. I know women aren't all the same but just head over to askwomen, no one likes a thin penis. If I bleed out then no one will ever be disappointed with my size, and i'll be forgotten soon enough. I can acknowledge that killing myself over this might be dumb, but I can't live knowing that no one will enjoy my size, and if I ever do get in a relationship then the woman will be settling for me. That would be an awful situation for both me and for her. I'm kind of rambling right now, sorry. I really appreciate you talking to me. | It's mostly because of my body, yes. I feel and know that I am inadequate. There are other issues like a general apathy towards life that i've unfortunately developed, and a feeling of hopelessness, but it's mostly because my body.

I feel like I haven't been through much. I've just been hurting myself. 

I'm truly sorry to hear that you've been hurting for so long. I really am. There was a short time where I didn't care about others opinions, but for some reason insecurity crept back in to my life.

You are kind to say that I am caring. The negative voices of the world can be very overpowering. But the women who hate my size have their reasons for it. It's possible that a woman could fall for me but it's very unlikely given my insecurities and the fact that I'm cutting myself over it. They'd rightly think i'm crazy. 

Honestly i've kind of calmed down now. I still want to bleed out, but i'm not as set on it as I was. I can't continue like this, though. I don't know what to do. I think i'll sleep on it. You don't know how much it means to me that you've been speaking with me.

I really hate the people that I encounter everyday and the system that was implemented in my school. 

I have no talent, I suck at everything I try, I'm bad at budgeting,  I'm really lazy, and now I'm at 10th grade and might not be able to graduate because of my bad grades. My parents didn't believe I was trying my hardest and said that my grades looked like I didn't care about it. 

and if I die no one be affected. My brother will be granted more stable financial support w/o me. I can't disappoint anyone anymore. No one would be bothered because of me. The world will just move on without me. At some point no one would be even able to remember me.

I tried to kill myself a few times but can't do it but I did it with a knife. If I do it with a rope I shouldn't be able to stop it right?",u/ifuckinghatemyself88,1,"Thanks, but everytime I fail at something I get depressed easily. | Hmm thanks Will, I might try one more time.
